# Sodium

**Normal Range:**  
135 – 145 mmol/L  

**Clinical Significance:**  
Sodium is the primary extracellular electrolyte, crucial for fluid balance, blood pressure regulation, and nerve/muscle function.  
- Hyponatremia (low sodium): Often due to fluid overload, SIADH, or heart/kidney failure.  
- Hypernatremia (high sodium): Usually due to dehydration, excess salt intake, or water loss.  

**Future Diseases:**  
- Hyponatremia → seizures, cerebral edema, heart failure complications  
- Hypernatremia → confusion, neuromuscular irritability, diabetes insipidus  
- Chronic imbalance → hypertension, kidney disease  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Stay well-hydrated  
- Avoid excessive salt intake  
- Monitor if taking diuretics or with kidney/heart disease  
- Regular blood tests if on long-term medications affecting electrolytes  

**Case Studies:**

Case 1 Input: Sodium = 140 mmol/L (male, 40 years old, healthy) Output: Normal sodium. No concerns.

Case 2 Input: Sodium = 132 mmol/L (female, 65 years old, on diuretics) Output: Mild hyponatremia → likely diuretic-induced.

Case 3 Input: Sodium = 148 mmol/L (male, 70 years old, dehydrated) Output: Hypernatremia → consistent with dehydration.

Case 4 Input: Sodium = 134 mmol/L (female, 45 years old, heart failure) Output: Hyponatremia → common in fluid overload states.

Case 5 Input: Sodium = 150 mmol/L (male, 25 years old, after intense exercise, inadequate water intake) Output: Hypernatremia → dehydration-related.

Case 6 Input: Sodium = 129 mmol/L (female, 55 years old, SIADH) Output: Significant hyponatremia → inappropriate ADH secretion.

Case 7 Input: Sodium = 144 mmol/L (male, 30 years old, athlete, well-hydrated) Output: Normal-high, acceptable with adequate fluid intake.

Case 8 Input: Sodium = 131 mmol/L (female, 75 years old, cirrhosis) Output: Hyponatremia → dilutional, secondary to advanced liver disease.

Case 9 Input: Sodium = 146 mmol/L (male, 65 years old, diabetes insipidus) Output: Mild hypernatremia → due to free water loss.

Case 10 Input: Sodium = 135 mmol/L (female, 20 years old, healthy) Output: Normal sodium.

Case 11 Input: Sodium = 128 mmol/L (male, 50 years old, chronic kidney disease) Output: Hyponatremia → impaired renal regulation of sodium/water.

Case 12 Input: Sodium = 147 mmol/L (female, 60 years old, high fever, dehydration) Output: Mild hypernatremia due to water deficit.

Case 13 Input: Sodium = 142 mmol/L (male, 18 years old, healthy) Output: Normal sodium balance.

Case 14 Input: Sodium = 133 mmol/L (female, 40 years old, marathon runner, excess water intake) Output: Hyponatremia → exercise-associated dilutional hyponatremia.

Case 15 Input: Sodium = 152 mmol/L (male, 72 years old, bedridden, poor oral intake) Output: Hypernatremia → inadequate hydration.

Case 16 Input: Sodium = 130 mmol/L (female, 25 years old, Addison’s disease) Output: Hyponatremia → adrenal insufficiency.

Case 17 Input: Sodium = 145 mmol/L (male, 45 years old, high-salt diet) Output: Upper limit of normal → monitor for hypertension risk.

Case 18 Input: Sodium = 138 mmol/L (female, 50 years old, hypothyroidism) Output: Normal sodium.

Case 19 Input: Sodium = 127 mmol/L (male, 68 years old, lung cancer with SIADH) Output: Severe hyponatremia due to SIADH.

Case 20 Input: Sodium = 149 mmol/L (female, 30 years old, post-vomiting illness) Output: Hypernatremia due to fluid loss.

Case 21 Input: Sodium = 136 mmol/L (male, 55 years old, stable health) Output: Normal.

Case 22 Input: Sodium = 132 mmol/L (female, 65 years old, heart failure on diuretics) Output: Hyponatremia → multifactorial (heart + medications).

Case 23 Input: Sodium = 153 mmol/L (male, 80 years old, dementia, poor water intake) Output: Hypernatremia due to dehydration.

Case 24 Input: Sodium = 140 mmol/L (female, 10 years old, healthy child) Output: Normal sodium.

Case 25 Input: Sodium = 129 mmol/L (male, 60 years old, postoperative, receiving IV fluids) Output: Hyponatremia → dilutional, secondary to inappropriate fluid management.
