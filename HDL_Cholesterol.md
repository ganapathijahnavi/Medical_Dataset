# High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol

**Normal Range:**  
- Men: > 40 mg/dL  
- Women: > 50 mg/dL  
- â‰¥ 60 mg/dL considered protective against heart disease  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
HDL is called the **"good cholesterol"** because it helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and carries it back to the liver for excretion.  
- **Low HDL** = increased cardiovascular risk  
- **High HDL** = protective effect against atherosclerosis  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Coronary artery disease  
- Atherosclerosis  
- Stroke  
- Metabolic syndrome  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Engage in **regular aerobic exercise** (walking, cycling, swimming)  
- Eat a **healthy diet** rich in omega-3 fatty acids, nuts, seeds, whole grains  
- **Avoid smoking** and limit alcohol  
- Maintain a healthy weight  
- Consider medical therapy if HDL is low and other cardiovascular risks are present

# Case Studies 

### Case 1  
**Input:** HDL = 65 mg/dL (male, 30 years, healthy)  
**Output:** Excellent HDL. Protective against heart disease.  

---

### Case 2  
**Input:** HDL = 38 mg/dL (female, 45 years, overweight)  
**Output:** Low HDL. Increased cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle changes needed.  

---

### Case 3  
**Input:** HDL = 55 mg/dL (male, 50 years, smoker)  
**Output:** Normal HDL, but smoking negates protective effects. Smoking cessation strongly advised.  

---

### Case 4  
**Input:** HDL = 70 mg/dL (female, 28 years, active lifestyle)  
**Output:** Very good HDL. Low risk for heart disease. Maintain lifestyle.  

---

### Case 5  
**Input:** HDL = 30 mg/dL (male, 60 years, diabetic)  
**Output:** Very low HDL. High risk for cardiovascular disease. Intensive lifestyle + medical therapy required.  

---

### Case 6  
**Input:** HDL = 52 mg/dL (female, 35 years, no comorbidities)  
**Output:** Healthy HDL. No concerns.  

---

### Case 7  
**Input:** HDL = 44 mg/dL (male, 25 years, obese)  
**Output:** Borderline normal HDL. Weight management recommended.  

---

### Case 8  
**Input:** HDL = 80 mg/dL (female, 50 years, healthy diet)  
**Output:** Excellent HDL, strong cardiovascular protection.  

---

### Case 9  
**Input:** HDL = 39 mg/dL (male, 40 years, sedentary)  
**Output:** Low HDL. Needs physical activity and dietary changes.  

---

### Case 10  
**Input:** HDL = 50 mg/dL (female, 60 years, hypertensive)  
**Output:** Normal HDL, but hypertension increases cardiovascular risk.  

---

### Case 11  
**Input:** HDL = 33 mg/dL (male, 55 years, chronic alcohol use)  
**Output:** Low HDL. Alcohol not effective in raising protective HDL. Needs intervention.  

---

### Case 12  
**Input:** HDL = 47 mg/dL (female, 25 years, athletic)  
**Output:** Normal HDL, exercise helps maintain.  

---

### Case 13  
**Input:** HDL = 29 mg/dL (male, 35 years, metabolic syndrome)  
**Output:** Very low HDL. Associated with high metabolic and cardiovascular risk.  

---

### Case 14  
**Input:** HDL = 62 mg/dL (female, 70 years, vegetarian diet)  
**Output:** Good HDL, diet supports cardiovascular health.  

---

### Case 15  
**Input:** HDL = 41 mg/dL (male, 22 years, high triglycerides)  
**Output:** Just above cutoff. High triglycerides offset benefit. Needs monitoring.  

---

### Case 16  
**Input:** HDL = 75 mg/dL (female, 40 years, healthy)  
**Output:** Excellent HDL, protective against heart disease.  

---

### Case 17  
**Input:** HDL = 36 mg/dL (male, 65 years, smoker, diabetic)  
**Output:** Low HDL with multiple risk factors. Very high cardiovascular risk.  

---

### Case 18  
**Input:** HDL = 58 mg/dL (female, 55 years, on statin therapy)  
**Output:** Normal HDL, statins primarily lower LDL but maintaining HDL is beneficial.  

---

### Case 19  
**Input:** HDL = 43 mg/dL (male, 30 years, overweight)  
**Output:** Borderline. Needs weight reduction and activity.  

---

### Case 20  
**Input:** HDL = 82 mg/dL (female, 20 years, athlete)  
**Output:** Very high HDL, excellent cardiovascular profile.  

---

### Case 21  
**Input:** HDL = 34 mg/dL (male, 45 years, high LDL cholesterol)  
**Output:** Low HDL + high LDL = double cardiovascular risk. Medical therapy likely required.  

---

### Case 22  
**Input:** HDL = 46 mg/dL (female, 38 years, moderate exercise)  
**Output:** Normal HDL, maintain activity.  

---

### Case 23  
**Input:** HDL = 28 mg/dL (male, 70 years, chronic kidney disease)  
**Output:** Very low HDL, high risk of atherosclerosis. Needs aggressive risk management.  

---

### Case 24  
**Input:** HDL = 60 mg/dL (female, 30 years, no risk factors)  
**Output:** Healthy HDL. Continue lifestyle measures.  

---

### Case 25  
**Input:** HDL = 35 mg/dL (male, 50 years, obese, hypertensive)  
**Output:** Low HDL with multiple risk factors. Requires urgent lifestyle and medical intervention.
