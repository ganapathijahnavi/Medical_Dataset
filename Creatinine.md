# Creatinine

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Men (adult):** 0.74 – 1.35 mg/dL (65 – 120 µmol/L)  
- **Women (adult):** 0.59 – 1.04 mg/dL (52 – 91 µmol/L)  
- **Children (1–18 years):** 0.3 – 0.7 mg/dL (27 – 62 µmol/L)  
- **Infants (up to 12 months):** 0.2 – 0.4 mg/dL (18 – 35 µmol/L)  
- **Newborns:** 0.3 – 1.0 mg/dL (varies in first week of life)   


**Clinical Significance:**  
Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle, cleared primarily by the kidneys.  
- **Low creatinine:** Uncommon, usually due to low muscle mass, malnutrition, or pregnancy.  
- **High creatinine:** Indicates reduced kidney function, dehydration, or increased muscle breakdown.  

Often used in combination with **estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)** to assess kidney function.  


**Future Diseases & Risks of Abnormal Levels:**  
- **High Creatinine:**  
  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
  - Acute kidney injury (AKI)  
  - Glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome  
  - Dehydration  
  - Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)  

- **Low Creatinine:**  
  - Low muscle mass (elderly, cachexia)  
  - Malnutrition  
  - Pregnancy (normal hemodilution effect)  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Stay well-hydrated  
- Avoid nephrotoxic medications (NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, contrast dyes)  
- Control blood pressure and diabetes to protect kidneys  
- Limit excess protein supplements if kidney function is impaired  
- Regular kidney function monitoring if at risk (hypertension, diabetes, family history of CKD)  

**Case Studies:** 
Case 1 – 1.2 mg/dL → Normal. Maintain hydration.

Case 2 – 0.8 mg/dL → Normal.

Case 3 – 2.0 mg/dL → Elevated, possible CKD. Nephrology consult.

Case 4 – 0.4 mg/dL → Low, normal in pregnancy.

Case 5 – 3.5 mg/dL → Critically high, advanced kidney disease.

Case 6 – 0.3 mg/dL → Normal for child.

Case 7 – 1.5 mg/dL → Slightly elevated, early CKD possible.

Case 8 – 0.6 mg/dL → Low, frailty/low muscle mass.

Case 9 – 5.0 mg/dL → Very high, possible rhabdomyolysis.

Case 10 – 1.0 mg/dL → Normal.

Case 11 – 2.8 mg/dL → High, drug-induced injury possible.

Case 12 – 0.9 mg/dL → Slightly high for child.

Case 13 – 7.0 mg/dL → Very high, advanced CKD on dialysis.

Case 14 – 1.4 mg/dL → Mildly elevated, monitor eGFR.

Case 15 – 0.2 mg/dL → Normal for infant.

Case 16 – 2.2 mg/dL → Elevated, possible cardiorenal syndrome.

Case 17 – 0.7 mg/dL → Normal-low, low muscle mass.

Case 18 – 4.0 mg/dL → Severely elevated, advanced kidney disease.

Case 19 – 1.8 mg/dL → Elevated, possible lupus nephritis.

Case 20 – 0.5 mg/dL → Low, malnutrition.

Case 21 – 6.5 mg/dL → Critically high, acute kidney injury.

Case 22 – 1.6 mg/dL → Slightly high, may reflect muscle mass or supplements.

Case 23 – 0.9 mg/dL → Normal, monitor in diabetes.

Case 24 – 2.5 mg/dL → Elevated, possible HIV-drug nephrotoxicity.

Case 25 – 12 mg/dL → Extremely high, ESRD awaiting transplant.
