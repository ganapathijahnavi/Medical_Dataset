# Creatinine

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Men (adult):** 0.74 – 1.35 mg/dL (65 – 120 µmol/L)  
- **Women (adult):** 0.59 – 1.04 mg/dL (52 – 91 µmol/L)  
- **Children (1–18 years):** 0.3 – 0.7 mg/dL (27 – 62 µmol/L)  
- **Infants (up to 12 months):** 0.2 – 0.4 mg/dL (18 – 35 µmol/L)  
- **Newborns:** 0.3 – 1.0 mg/dL (varies in first week of life)

**Clinical Significance:**  
Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle, cleared primarily by the kidneys.  
- **Low creatinine:** Uncommon, usually due to low muscle mass, malnutrition, or pregnancy.  
- **High creatinine:** Indicates reduced kidney function, dehydration, or increased muscle breakdown.  

Often used in combination with **estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)** to assess kidney function.  

---

**Future Diseases & Risks of Abnormal Levels:**  
- **High Creatinine:**  
  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
  - Acute kidney injury (AKI)  
  - Glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome  
  - Dehydration  
  - Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)  

- **Low Creatinine:**  
  - Low muscle mass (elderly, cachexia)  
  - Malnutrition  
  - Pregnancy (normal hemodilution effect)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Stay well-hydrated  
- Avoid nephrotoxic medications (NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, contrast dyes)  
- Control blood pressure and diabetes to protect kidneys  
- Limit excess protein supplements if kidney function is impaired  
- Regular kidney function monitoring if at risk (hypertension, diabetes, family history of CKD)

---

### Case 9  
**Input:** Creatinine = 5.0 mg/dL (male, 40 years old, trauma with muscle injury)  
**Output:** Very high, possible rhabdomyolysis.  
**Recommendation:** Emergency care, IV fluids, monitor electrolytes.  

---

### Case 10
