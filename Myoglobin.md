# Myoglobin

**Normal Range:**  
Men: 28 – 72 ng/mL  
Women: 25 – 58 ng/mL  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Myoglobin is an oxygen-binding protein found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. It is one of the **earliest markers to rise after muscle injury**, appearing within 2–3 hours after myocardial infarction (MI). However, it lacks specificity because it also increases with skeletal muscle damage, trauma, or renal disease.

**Future Diseases / Conditions:**  
- Myocardial infarction (early marker)  
- Rhabdomyolysis  
- Muscular dystrophy  
- Acute kidney injury (due to myoglobinuria)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain cardiovascular health  
- Avoid muscle overexertion or injury  
- Stay hydrated to protect kidneys if muscle breakdown occurs  
- Regular check-ups if at risk for heart disease

## Case Interpretations (25 Cases)

### Case 1  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 40 ng/mL, healthy male  
**Output:** Normal. No evidence of muscle or cardiac injury.  

### Case 2  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 30 ng/mL, healthy female  
**Output:** Normal.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 150 ng/mL, chest pain for 2 hours  
**Output:** Elevated. Could be early myocardial infarction. Needs troponin follow-up.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 300 ng/mL, severe chest pain + shortness of breath  
**Output:** High. Suggests acute myocardial infarction. Confirm with troponin and ECG.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 500 ng/mL, crush injury to leg  
**Output:** Elevated due to skeletal muscle damage. Risk of rhabdomyolysis.  

### Case 6  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 250 ng/mL, marathon runner post-race  
**Output:** Elevated from muscle exertion, not heart attack.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 120 ng/mL, patient with mild renal impairment  
**Output:** Mildly elevated. Clearance reduced due to kidney dysfunction.  

### Case 8  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 1,000 ng/mL, acute kidney injury  
**Output:** Extremely high. Likely rhabdomyolysis. Risk of myoglobin-induced nephrotoxicity.  

### Case 9  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 200 ng/mL, chest pain but normal ECG  
**Output:** Elevated. Possible early MI, needs serial cardiac markers.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 80 ng/mL, hypertensive male, no symptoms  
**Output:** Slightly elevated. Needs monitoring for hidden muscle or cardiac stress.  

### Case 11  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 75 ng/mL, elderly woman  
**Output:** Borderline high. Recheck to rule out early cardiac issues.  

### Case 12  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 400 ng/mL, multiple trauma patient  
**Output:** High due to muscle injury. Not specific to heart.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 180 ng/mL, diabetic with chest pain  
**Output:** Elevated. Rule out acute coronary syndrome.  

### Case 14  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 600 ng/mL, patient with seizures  
**Output:** High due to muscle breakdown from seizure activity.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 50 ng/mL, young athlete at rest  
**Output:** Normal. No evidence of muscle injury.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 280 ng/mL, patient with pneumonia  
**Output:** Mildly high, possibly due to generalized stress or minor muscle breakdown.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 350 ng/mL, CK and troponin normal  
**Output:** Likely skeletal muscle injury, not cardiac.  

### Case 18  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 220 ng/mL, patient with heart failure  
**Output:** Elevated. May reflect cardiac stress.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 140 ng/mL, pregnant woman with leg cramps  
**Output:** Mildly elevated. Likely muscular in origin.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 900 ng/mL, patient with statin-induced myopathy  
**Output:** Very high. Suggests severe skeletal muscle breakdown.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 250 ng/mL, after CPR resuscitation  
**Output:** Elevated due to chest compressions and cardiac injury.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 320 ng/mL, chronic alcoholic with muscle wasting  
**Output:** Elevated. Muscle breakdown from chronic alcohol toxicity.  

### Case 23  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 60 ng/mL, elderly male, asymptomatic  
**Output:** Normal. No clinical concern.  

### Case 24  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 1,200 ng/mL, crush syndrome  
**Output:** Very high. Immediate risk of acute kidney failure. Emergency treatment required.  

### Case 25  
**Input:** Myoglobin = 100 ng/mL, chest pain 1 hour ago  
**Output:** Early elevation possible. Needs serial myoglobin + troponin to confirm MI.
