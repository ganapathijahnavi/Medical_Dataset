# Amylase

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- Adults: **30 – 110 U/L**  
- Children: Similar to adults (30 – 110 U/L)  
- Newborns/infants: Slightly lower in some labs  

**Clinical Significance:**  
Amylase is an enzyme produced mainly by the **pancreas and salivary glands**. It helps break down carbohydrates.  
- **Elevated levels** are most commonly associated with **acute pancreatitis**, salivary gland disorders, or pancreatic cancer.  
- **Low levels** may occur in chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or severe pancreatic damage.  


**Future Diseases Associated with Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Pancreatitis** (acute, chronic)  
- **Pancreatic cancer**  
- **Gallstones causing pancreatic obstruction**  
- **Salivary gland disease (mumps, obstruction)**  
- **Kidney disease (reduced clearance of amylase)**  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- **Avoid alcohol** (major risk factor for pancreatitis).  
- Follow a **low-fat, balanced diet**.  
- Stay **hydrated**.  
- Regular **medical monitoring** if at risk (history of gallstones, pancreatic disease).  
- Seek urgent care if symptoms like **severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting** occur.

Input: Amylase = 60 U/L (female, 45 years old, malnutrition)
Output: Normal-low, but not clinically significant.
Recommendation: Nutrition improvement.

Case 19
Input: Amylase = 210 U/L (male, 32 years old, HIV positive)
