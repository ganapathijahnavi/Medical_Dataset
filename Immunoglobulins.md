# Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE) — Case Interpretations


**Normal Ranges:**  
- **IgG:** 700 – 1600 mg/dL  
- **IgA:** 70 – 400 mg/dL  
- **IgM:** 40 – 230 mg/dL  
- **IgE:** <100 IU/mL (may vary by age and allergy status)

**Clinical Significance:**  
Immunoglobulins (antibodies) are proteins produced by plasma cells to help the body fight infections.  
Abnormal levels indicate immune system disorders, infections, allergies, or certain cancers.

**Future Diseases:**  
- Immunodeficiency disorders (low Ig levels)  
- Autoimmune diseases  
- Chronic infections  
- Allergic disorders (elevated IgE)  
- Multiple myeloma or Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia

## Case 1
**Input:**  
IgG = 500 mg/dL (low), recurrent sinus infections  

**Output:**  
Your IgG is below normal, suggesting **possible immunodeficiency (e.g., CVID)**. This explains recurrent infections. You should seek immunology evaluation.

---

## Case 2
**Input:**  
IgA = 30 mg/dL (low), frequent diarrhea and sinus infections  

**Output:**  
Low IgA indicates **Selective IgA Deficiency**, leading to recurrent respiratory and GI infections. Regular monitoring and infection prevention are recommended.

---

## Case 3
**Input:**  
IgM = 300 mg/dL (high), anemia and fatigue  

**Output:**  
Elevated IgM may suggest **Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia** or chronic infection. Further hematology workup is needed.

---

## Case 4
**Input:**  
IgE = 500 IU/mL, severe seasonal allergies  

**Output:**  
High IgE is consistent with **allergic rhinitis/asthma**. Allergy management and antihistamines are recommended.

---

## Case 5
**Input:**  
IgG = 2,000 mg/dL (high), chronic hepatitis  

**Output:**  
Elevated IgG suggests **chronic liver disease or autoimmune hepatitis**. A liver panel and specialist consultation are required.

---

## Case 6
**Input:**  
IgA = 450 mg/dL (high), kidney problems (protein in urine)  

**Output:**  
High IgA with renal findings may indicate **IgA nephropathy**. Nephrology follow-up is essential.

---

## Case 7
**Input:**  
IgM = 20 mg/dL (low), child with recurrent ear infections  

**Output:**  
Low IgM can indicate **primary immunodeficiency**. Pediatric immunology evaluation is advised.

---

## Case 8
**Input:**  
IgE = 20 IU/mL (normal), frequent colds  

**Output:**  
Normal IgE suggests infections are likely **viral** rather than allergic. Supportive care and general immunity measures are sufficient.

---

## Case 9
**Input:**  
IgG = 3,000 mg/dL (very high), bone pain and anemia  

**Output:**  
Markedly high IgG could indicate **multiple myeloma**. Urgent hematology referral is needed.

---

## Case 10
**Input:**  
IgA = 10 mg/dL (very low), adult with recurrent pneumonia  

**Output:**  
Extremely low IgA suggests **severe selective IgA deficiency**. Preventive care and possible immunoglobulin therapy are required.

---

## Case 11
**Input:**  
IgM = 180 mg/dL (normal), otherwise healthy adult  

**Output:**  
IgM is within the normal range. No immune disorder is suggested. Maintain a healthy lifestyle.

---

## Case 12
**Input:**  
IgE = 800 IU/mL, eczema and asthma  

**Output:**  
Elevated IgE with skin and respiratory issues points to **atopic disease**. Long-term allergy and dermatology care may be required.

---

## Case 13
**Input:**  
IgG = 650 mg/dL (slightly low), frequent bronchitis  

**Output:**  
Mildly reduced IgG may suggest **secondary immunodeficiency** (possibly medication-related). Further workup needed.

---

## Case 14
**Input:**  
IgA = 390 mg/dL (upper limit), alcohol use, liver disease  

**Output:**  
High IgA can be associated with **liver cirrhosis**. Reducing alcohol and monitoring liver function are advised.

---

## Case 15
**Input:**  
IgM = 500 mg/dL (very high), night sweats and weight loss  

**Output:**  
Very high IgM suggests **hematological malignancy** such as Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. Immediate hematology referral required.

---

## Case 16
**Input:**  
IgE = 50 IU/mL, frequent chest infections  

**Output:**  
Normal IgE but recurrent infections point toward **non-allergic immunodeficiency**. Further IgG/IgA/IgM testing is needed.

---

## Case 17
**Input:**  
IgG = 1,200 mg/dL (normal), patient vaccinated against flu  

**Output:**  
Normal IgG and vaccination response indicate **healthy immune function**. Continue routine healthcare.

---

## Case 18
**Input:**  
IgA = 100 mg/dL (normal), frequent food allergies  

**Output:**  
Normal IgA suggests allergies are **IgE-mediated**, not due to IgA deficiency. Allergy testing is recommended.

---

## Case 19
**Input:**  
IgM = 30 mg/dL (low), child with delayed growth and infections  

**Output:**  
Low IgM may reflect **primary immunodeficiency syndrome**. Pediatric immunology care is required.

---

## Case 20
**Input:**  
IgE = 2,000 IU/mL, chronic asthma unresponsive to therapy  

**Output:**  
Very high IgE suggests **severe atopic disease or parasitic infection**. Consider referral for biologic therapy (omalizumab).

---

## Case 21
**Input:**  
IgG = 400 mg/dL (low), elderly patient with pneumonia  

**Output:**  
Low IgG suggests **secondary immunodeficiency** (possibly age or cancer-related). Immunoglobulin replacement therapy may be considered.

---

## Case 22
**Input:**  
IgA = 250 mg/dL (normal), celiac disease diagnosed  

**Output:**  
Even with normal IgA, **celiac disease is confirmed by antibody testing**. Gluten-free diet recommended.

---

## Case 23
**Input:**  
IgM = 90 mg/dL (normal), recovered viral infection  

**Output:**  
Normal IgM indicates **healthy acute immune response**. No further intervention needed.

---

## Case 24
**Input:**  
IgE = 600 IU/mL, parasitic infection  

**Output:**  
High IgE is consistent with **parasitic disease**. Anti-parasitic therapy is required.

---

## Case 25
**Input:**  
All immunoglobulins low (IgG, IgA, IgM), recurrent infections  

**Output:**  
Low levels across immunoglobulins indicate **combined immunodeficiency**. Lifelong medical follow-up and possible immunoglobulin replacement are required.
