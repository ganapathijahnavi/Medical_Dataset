# Immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE) — Case Interpretations


**Normal Ranges:**  
- **IgG:** 700 – 1600 mg/dL  
- **IgA:** 70 – 400 mg/dL  
- **IgM:** 40 – 230 mg/dL  
- **IgE:** <100 IU/mL (may vary by age and allergy status)

**Clinical Significance:**  
Immunoglobulins (antibodies) are proteins produced by plasma cells to help the body fight infections.  
Abnormal levels indicate immune system disorders, infections, allergies, or certain cancers.

**Future Diseases:**  
- Immunodeficiency disorders (low Ig levels)  
- Autoimmune diseases  
- Chronic infections  
- Allergic disorders (elevated IgE)  
- Multiple myeloma or Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia
  


Case 1

Input: IgG = 500 mg/dL (low), recurrent sinus infections
Output: Possible immunodeficiency (e.g., CVID). Recurrent infections explained. Immunology evaluation recommended.

Case 2

Input: IgA = 30 mg/dL (low), frequent diarrhea and sinus infections
Output: Suggests Selective IgA Deficiency. Monitor infections, preventive care advised.

Case 3

Input: IgM = 300 mg/dL (high), anemia and fatigue
Output: May indicate Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia or chronic infection. Hematology workup needed.

Case 4

Input: IgE = 500 IU/mL, severe seasonal allergies
Output: Consistent with allergic rhinitis/asthma. Allergy management recommended.

Case 5

Input: IgG = 2,000 mg/dL (high), chronic hepatitis
Output: Suggests chronic liver disease or autoimmune hepatitis. Liver panel and specialist consult needed.

Case 6

Input: IgA = 450 mg/dL (high), kidney problems (proteinuria)
Output: May indicate IgA nephropathy. Nephrology follow-up essential.

Case 7

Input: IgM = 20 mg/dL (low), child with recurrent ear infections
Output: Possible primary immunodeficiency. Pediatric immunology evaluation advised.

Case 8

Input: IgE = 20 IU/mL (normal), frequent colds
Output: Normal IgE suggests viral infections. Supportive care sufficient.

Case 9

Input: IgG = 3,000 mg/dL (very high), bone pain and anemia
Output: Could indicate multiple myeloma. Urgent hematology referral needed.

Case 10

Input: IgA = 10 mg/dL (very low), adult with recurrent pneumonia
Output: Suggests severe selective IgA deficiency. Preventive care and possible immunoglobulin therapy required.

Case 11

Input: IgM = 180 mg/dL (normal), otherwise healthy adult
Output: Normal. No immune disorder. Maintain healthy lifestyle.

Case 12

Input: IgE = 800 IU/mL, eczema and asthma
Output: Elevated IgE with symptoms indicates atopic disease. Long-term allergy/dermatology care may be needed.

Case 13

Input: IgG = 650 mg/dL (slightly low), frequent bronchitis
Output: Mild reduction may suggest secondary immunodeficiency (possibly medication-related). Further workup needed.

Case 14

Input: IgA = 390 mg/dL (upper limit), alcohol use, liver disease
Output: High IgA can be linked to liver cirrhosis. Alcohol reduction and monitoring advised.

Case 15

Input: IgM = 500 mg/dL (very high), night sweats and weight loss
Output: Suggests hematological malignancy (e.g., Waldenström’s). Immediate referral required.

Case 16

Input: IgE = 50 IU/mL, frequent chest infections
Output: Normal IgE but recurrent infections suggest non-allergic immunodeficiency. Further testing needed.

Case 17

Input: IgG = 1,200 mg/dL (normal), patient vaccinated against flu
Output: Normal. Healthy immune function. Continue routine care.

Case 18

Input: IgA = 100 mg/dL (normal), frequent food allergies
Output: Normal IgA; allergies likely IgE-mediated. Allergy testing recommended.

Case 19

Input: IgM = 30 mg/dL (low), child with delayed growth and infections
Output: Suggests primary immunodeficiency syndrome. Pediatric immunology care required.

Case 20

Input: IgE = 2,000 IU/mL, chronic asthma unresponsive to therapy
Output: Very high IgE indicates severe atopic disease or parasitic infection. Consider biologic therapy (omalizumab).

Case 21

Input: IgG = 400 mg/dL (low), elderly patient with pneumonia
Output: Suggests secondary immunodeficiency (age or cancer-related). Immunoglobulin replacement may be needed.

Case 22

Input: IgA = 250 mg/dL (normal), celiac disease diagnosed
Output: IgA normal; celiac confirmed via antibody testing. Gluten-free diet recommended.

Case 23

Input: IgM = 90 mg/dL (normal), recovered viral infection
Output: Normal. Indicates healthy acute immune response.

Case 24

Input: IgE = 600 IU/mL, parasitic infection
Output: High IgE consistent with parasitic disease. Anti-parasitic therapy required.

Case 25

Input: All immunoglobulins low (IgG, IgA, IgM), recurrent infections
Output: Indicates combined immunodeficiency. Lifelong follow-up and possible immunoglobulin therapy required.
