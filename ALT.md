# Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Adults:** 7 – 56 IU/L  
- **Children:** 5 – 45 IU/L  
- **Newborns/infants:** Slightly higher values may be normal    

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
ALT is an enzyme found mainly in the liver. It is released into the bloodstream when liver cells are damaged.  
- **High ALT:** Suggests liver injury or inflammation.  
- **Mild elevation:** May occur in fatty liver or alcohol use.  
- **Severe elevation (>10x normal):** Often due to acute hepatitis, drug-induced injury, or ischemic liver damage.  

---

**Future Diseases Associated with Abnormal Levels:**  
- Hepatitis (viral, autoimmune, drug-induced)  
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)  
- Alcoholic liver disease  
- Cirrhosis  
- Liver cancer (HCC)  
- Muscle disorders (rare cause of mild ALT rise)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid or limit alcohol intake  
- Maintain healthy weight, exercise regularly  
- Follow a balanced diet (low processed foods, high in fruits/vegetables)  
- Manage diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol  
- Avoid unnecessary medications or toxins harmful to liver  
- Regular monitoring if ALT is persistently elevated
