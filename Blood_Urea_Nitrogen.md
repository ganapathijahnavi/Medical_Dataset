# Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Adults:** 7 – 20 mg/dL (2.5 – 7.1 mmol/L)  
- **Children:** 5 – 18 mg/dL  
- **Infants:** 3 – 12 mg/dL  
- **Newborns:** 3 – 12 mg/dL  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
BUN reflects the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood, a waste product from protein metabolism, excreted by the kidneys.  
- **High BUN:** May indicate kidney dysfunction, dehydration, high protein diet, or heart failure.  
- **Low BUN:** Can result from liver disease, malnutrition, or overhydration.  
BUN is most useful when interpreted with **creatinine** to evaluate kidney function.  

---

**Future Diseases & Risks of Abnormal Levels:**  
- **High BUN:**  
  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
  - Acute kidney injury (AKI)  
  - Heart failure  
  - Gastrointestinal bleeding  
  - Severe dehydration  

- **Low BUN:**  
  - Severe liver disease  
  - Malnutrition / low protein intake  
  - Overhydration (SIADH, IV fluids)  
  - Pregnancy (normal physiologic changes)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Stay hydrated with adequate fluid intake  
- Limit high-protein diet if kidney disease is present  
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, contrast dyes)  
- Manage blood pressure and diabetes to protect kidneys  
- Regularly monitor BUN/creatinine if at risk for renal disease

**Recommendation:** Nephrology consult, monitor creatinine and eGFR.  

---

### Case 6  
**Input:** BUN = 5 mg/dL (child, 8 years old)  
**Output:** Lower end of normal for child.  
**Recommendation:** Monitor, ensure proper nutrition.  

---

### Case 7  
**Input:** BUN = 65 mg/dL (male, 72 years old, heart failure)  
**Output:** Very high, may reflect poor kidney perfusion from heart failure.  
**Recommendation:** Cardiologist and nephrologist management.  

---

### Case 8  
**Input:** BUN = 3 mg/dL (infant, 2 months old)  
**Output:** Low, can be normal for infants.  
**Recommendation:** Pediatric monitoring only.  

---

### Case 9  
**Input:** BUN = 70 mg/dL (male, 55 years old, dehydrated)  
**Output:** Critically high, likely dehydration or kidney injury.  
**Recommendation:** IV fluids, urgent care.  

---

### Case 10  
**Input:** BUN = 8 mg/dL (female, 30 years old, pregnant)  
**Output:** Slightly low, normal in pregnancy.  
**Recommendation:** Monitor, no concern.  

---

### Case 11  
**Input:** BUN = 40 mg/dL (male, 45 years old, GI bleeding)  
**Output:** Elevated due to increased protein absorption from bleeding.  
**Recommendation:** Treat underlying bleed, monitor kidneys.  

---

### Case 12  
**Input:** BUN = 60 mg/dL (male, 65 years old, CKD)  
**Output:** Consistent with chronic kidney disease.  
**Recommendation:** Nephrology follow-up, consider dialysis planning.  

---

### Case 13  
**Input:** BUN = 20 mg/dL (female, 55 years old)  
**Output:** High-normal.  
**Recommendation:** Monitor hydration and protein intake.  

---

### Case 14  
**Input:** BUN = 12 mg/dL (child, 10 years old)

**Recommendation:** Routine follow-up.  

---

### Case 15  
**Input:** BUN = 100 mg/dL (male, 70 years old, on dialysis)  
**Output:** Extremely high, consistent with ESRD.  
**Recommendation:** Continue dialysis and nephrology care.  

---

### Case 16  
**Input:** BUN = 7 mg/dL (female, 60 years old, malnourished)

---

### Case 17  
**Input:** BUN = 30 mg/dL (male, 40 years old, bodybuilder on high protein diet)  
**Output:** Elevated, may be diet-related.

---

### Case 18  
**Input:** BUN = 4 mg/dL (female, 25 years old, liver cirrhosis)
