# Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Adults:** 7 – 20 mg/dL (2.5 – 7.1 mmol/L)  
- **Children:** 5 – 18 mg/dL  
- **Infants:** 3 – 12 mg/dL  
- **Newborns:** 3 – 12 mg/dL  


**Clinical Significance:**  
BUN reflects the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood, a waste product from protein metabolism, excreted by the kidneys.  
- **High BUN:** May indicate kidney dysfunction, dehydration, high protein diet, or heart failure.  
- **Low BUN:** Can result from liver disease, malnutrition, or overhydration.  
BUN is most useful when interpreted with **creatinine** to evaluate kidney function.  

**Future Diseases & Risks of Abnormal Levels:**  
- **High BUN:**  
  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
  - Acute kidney injury (AKI)  
  - Heart failure  
  - Gastrointestinal bleeding  
  - Severe dehydration  

- **Low BUN:**  
  - Severe liver disease  
  - Malnutrition / low protein intake  
  - Overhydration (SIADH, IV fluids)  
  - Pregnancy (normal physiologic changes)  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Stay hydrated with adequate fluid intake  
- Limit high-protein diet if kidney disease is present  
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, contrast dyes)  
- Manage blood pressure and diabetes to protect kidneys  
- Regularly monitor BUN/creatinine if at risk for renal disease  


# Case Studies 

Case 1
Input: BUN = 15 mg/dL (male, 35 years old)
Output: Normal.
Recommendation: Maintain hydration and healthy diet.

Case 2
Input: BUN = 9 mg/dL (female, 25 years old)
Output: Normal.
Recommendation: No intervention needed.

Case 3
Input: BUN = 28 mg/dL (male, 60 years old, hypertensive)
Output: Elevated, possible early kidney disease or dehydration.
Recommendation: Increase fluids, evaluate renal function.

Case 4
Input: BUN = 6 mg/dL (female, 40 years old, vegan)
Output: Slightly low, possibly low protein intake.
Recommendation: Balanced protein nutrition.

Case 5
Input: BUN = 45 mg/dL (male, 70 years old, diabetic)
Output: High, indicates impaired kidney function.
Recommendation: Nephrology consult, monitor creatinine and eGFR.

Case 6
Input: BUN = 5 mg/dL (child, 8 years old)
Output: Lower end of normal for child.
Recommendation: Monitor, ensure proper nutrition.

Case 7
Input: BUN = 65 mg/dL (male, 72 years old, heart failure)
Output: Very high, may reflect poor kidney perfusion from heart failure.
Recommendation: Cardiologist and nephrologist management.

Case 8
Input: BUN = 3 mg/dL (infant, 2 months old)
Output: Low, can be normal for infants.
Recommendation: Pediatric monitoring only.

Case 9
Input: BUN = 70 mg/dL (male, 55 years old, dehydrated)
Output: Critically high, likely dehydration or kidney injury.
Recommendation: IV fluids, urgent care.

Case 10
Input: BUN = 8 mg/dL (female, 30 years old, pregnant)
Output: Slightly low, normal in pregnancy.
Recommendation: Monitor, no concern.

Case 11
Input: BUN = 40 mg/dL (male, 45 years old, GI bleeding)
Output: Elevated due to increased protein absorption from bleeding.
Recommendation: Treat underlying bleed, monitor kidneys.

Case 12
Input: BUN = 60 mg/dL (male, 65 years old, CKD)
Output: Consistent with chronic kidney disease.
Recommendation: Nephrology follow-up, consider dialysis planning.

Case 13
Input: BUN = 20 mg/dL (female, 55 years old)
Output: High-normal.
Recommendation: Monitor hydration and protein intake.

Case 14
Input: BUN = 12 mg/dL (child, 10 years old)
Output: Normal for age.
Recommendation: Routine follow-up.

Case 15
Input: BUN = 100 mg/dL (male, 70 years old, on dialysis)
Output: Extremely high, consistent with ESRD.
Recommendation: Continue dialysis and nephrology care.

Case 16
Input: BUN = 7 mg/dL (female, 60 years old, malnourished)
Output: Lower normal, possible malnutrition.
Recommendation: Nutrition support, monitor labs.

Case 17
Input: BUN = 30 mg/dL (male, 40 years old, bodybuilder on high protein diet)
Output: Elevated, may be diet-related.
Recommendation: Reassess diet, check creatinine to rule out renal disease.

Case 18
Input: BUN = 4 mg/dL (female, 25 years old, liver cirrhosis)
Output: Low, impaired urea synthesis due to liver disease.
Recommendation: Hepatology care.

Case 19
Input: BUN = 55 mg/dL (male, 80 years old, dehydration + diuretics)
Output: Elevated, likely dehydration.
Recommendation: Rehydrate, adjust medications.

Case 20
Input: BUN = 10 mg/dL (female, 18 years old, healthy athlete)
Output: Normal.
Recommendation: Maintain hydration.

Case 21
Input: BUN = 38 mg/dL (male, 50 years old, lupus nephritis)
Output: Elevated, possible kidney involvement.
Recommendation: Rheumatology and nephrology management.

Case 22
Input: BUN = 16 mg/dL (female, 30 years old)
Output: Normal.
Recommendation: Routine monitoring.

Case 23
Input: BUN = 48 mg/dL (male, 65 years old, high-protein diet + CKD)
Output: High, worsened by diet.
Recommendation: Reduce protein intake, follow renal diet.

Case 24
Input: BUN = 5 mg/dL (male, 70 years old, overhydrated with IV fluids)
Output: Low due to dilutional effect.
Recommendation: Adjust fluid therapy.

Case 25
Input: BUN = 85 mg/dL (female, 68 years old, acute renal failure)
Output: Critically high, severe kidney dysfunction.
Recommendation: Emergency nephrology care, possible dialysis.
