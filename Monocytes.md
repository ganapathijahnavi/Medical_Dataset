# Monocytes

**Normal Range:**  
2% – 8% of total WBC count (≈ 200 – 800 cells/µL)

**Clinical Significance:**  
Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, playing a key role in fighting infections and regulating immune responses. Abnormal levels may indicate infection, chronic inflammation, or hematologic disease.

**Future Diseases (if abnormal):**  
- **Monocytosis (high):** Tuberculosis, chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, leukemia  
- **Monocytopenia (low):** Bone marrow failure, chemotherapy, corticosteroid use, aplastic anemia  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain strong immune health through balanced nutrition  
- Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol  
- Manage chronic inflammatory conditions  
- Follow up with physician for abnormal counts

## Input/Output Cases

1. **Input:** Monocytes 12%, fever, night sweats  
   **Output:** Monocytosis suggesting tuberculosis or chronic infection  

2. **Input:** Monocytes 9%, rheumatoid arthritis patient  
   **Output:** Elevated due to chronic autoimmune inflammation  

3. **Input:** Monocytes 1%, chemotherapy patient  
   **Output:** Chemotherapy-induced monocytopenia → High infection risk  

4. **Input:** Monocytes 10%, persistent sore throat, weight loss  
   **Output:** Could indicate hematologic malignancy (leukemia)  

5. **Input:** Monocytes 7%, mild viral illness  
   **Output:** Slight elevation due to viral infection → Usually self-limiting  

6. **Input:** Monocytes 3%, healthy adult  
   **Output:** Normal → No concern
