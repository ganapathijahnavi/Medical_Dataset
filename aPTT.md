# Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)

**Normal Range:**  
30 to 40 seconds  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
aPTT assesses the intrinsic and common clotting pathways. It is used to evaluate bleeding disorders, monitor anticoagulant therapy (e.g., heparin), and screen for clotting factor deficiencies.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Clotting factor deficiencies (Hemophilia A, Hemophilia B, von Willebrand disease)  
- Liver disease  
- Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome  
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Regular monitoring if on anticoagulant therapy  
- Avoid unnecessary injury and trauma  
- Follow up with hematologist if persistently abnormal  
- Inform healthcare providers before surgery if abnormal

## Case Interpretations

### Case 1  
**Input:** aPTT = 32 sec  
**Output:** Normal. No clotting disorder detected.  

### Case 2  
**Input:** aPTT = 28 sec  
**Output:** Slightly below normal; may reflect lab variation. Usually not clinically significant.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** aPTT = 38 sec  
**Output:** Within normal range. Stable clotting function.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** aPTT = 45 sec  
**Output:** Mildly prolonged. Could indicate early clotting factor deficiency or anticoagulant effect.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** aPTT = 60 sec, on heparin  
**Output:** Prolonged as expected. Therapeutic monitoring required.  

### Case 6  
**Input:** aPTT = 70 sec, not on anticoagulants  
**Output:** Abnormal. Possible clotting factor deficiency (e.g., hemophilia) or liver dysfunction.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** aPTT = 90 sec, active bleeding  
**Output:** Critically prolonged. High risk of bleeding. Urgent hematology evaluation required.  

### Case 8  
**Input:** aPTT = 33 sec  
**Output:** Normal. No issues.  

### Case 9  
**Input:** aPTT = 50 sec, post-surgery  
**Output:** Elevated. May reflect intraoperative heparin exposure or coagulation abnormality.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** aPTT = 30 sec  
**Output:** Lower normal limit. Healthy clotting function.  

### Case 11  
**Input:** aPTT = 80 sec, patient with bruising  
**Output:** Prolonged. Suggests bleeding disorder such as hemophilia or DIC.  

### Case 12  
**Input:** aPTT = 35 sec  
**Output:** Normal. Stable clotting activity.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** aPTT = 42 sec  
**Output:** Slightly prolonged. Could indicate mild factor deficiency or lupus anticoagulant.  

### Case 14  
**Input:** aPTT = 37 sec, pregnant female  
**Output:** Within normal. No clotting abnormalities.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** aPTT = 29 sec  
**Output:** Just below range. Usually insignificant unless symptoms present.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** aPTT = 65 sec, on anticoagulation therapy  
**Output:** Expected therapeutic prolongation. Continue close monitoring.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** aPTT = 120 sec  
**Output:** Critically high. Severe risk of hemorrhage. Immediate intervention required.  

### Case 18  
**Input:** aPTT = 36 sec  
**Output:** Normal. No abnormalities.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** aPTT = 55 sec, liver cirrhosis  
**Output:** Elevated. Consistent with liver-related clotting factor deficiency.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** aPTT = 47 sec  
**Output:** Mild prolongation. Further workup recommended.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** aPTT = 75 sec, patient with hemophilia A  
**Output:** Prolonged. Consistent with factor VIII deficiency.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** aPTT = 40 sec  
**Output:** Upper normal limit. Normal clotting function.  

### Case 23  
**Input:** aPTT = 52 sec, history of lupus anticoagulant  
**Output:** Elevated. Consistent with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.  

### Case 24  
**Input:** aPTT = 31 sec  
**Output:** Normal. No issues.  

### Case 25  
**Input:** aPTT = 85 sec, patient with bleeding gums  
**Output:** Markedly prolonged. Suggests severe clotting factor deficiency. Immediate medical care required.
