# Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Adults:** 200 – 900 pg/mL (148 – 665 pmol/L)  
- **Borderline:** 200 – 300 pg/mL → further testing (MMA, homocysteine) may be needed  
- **Deficient:** < 200 pg/mL   

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Vitamin B12 is essential for:  
- Red blood cell production  
- DNA synthesis  
- Nerve cell function and myelin sheath maintenance  
- Brain health and energy metabolism  

**Low Vitamin B12:** Can lead to megaloblastic anemia, neurological issues, memory problems, and fatigue.  
**High Vitamin B12:** Often due to supplementation, but sometimes linked to liver disease, kidney disease, or blood cancers.  

---

**Future Diseases Associated with Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Deficiency:**  
  - Pernicious anemia  
  - Megaloblastic anemia  
  - Peripheral neuropathy  
  - Cognitive decline, dementia  
  - Depression, fatigue  
- **Excess (rare):**  
  - May indicate liver disease, kidney dysfunction, or myeloproliferative disorders  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Eat Vitamin B12-rich foods (meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, fortified cereals)  
- Vegans/vegetarians: use B12 supplements or fortified foods  
- Older adults and people with GI disorders (Crohn’s, celiac, bariatric surgery) should monitor levels regularly  
- Avoid excessive alcohol intake, which can worsen deficiency
