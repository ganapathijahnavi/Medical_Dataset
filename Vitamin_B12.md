# Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- Adults: 200 – 900 pg/mL (148 – 665 pmol/L)  
- Borderline: 200 – 300 pg/mL → further testing (MMA, homocysteine) may be needed  
- Deficient: < 200 pg/mL  

**Clinical Significance:**  
Vitamin B12 is essential for:  
- Red blood cell production  
- DNA synthesis  
- Nerve cell function and myelin sheath maintenance  
- Brain health and energy metabolism  

Low Vitamin B12 can lead to megaloblastic anemia, neurological issues, memory problems, and fatigue.  
High Vitamin B12 is often due to supplementation but may indicate liver disease, kidney disease, or blood cancers.  

**Future Diseases Associated with Abnormal Levels:**  
- Deficiency: Pernicious anemia, megaloblastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive decline, dementia, depression, fatigue  
- Excess (rare): May indicate liver disease, kidney dysfunction, or myeloproliferative disorders  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Eat Vitamin B12-rich foods (meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, fortified cereals)  
- Vegans/vegetarians should use B12 supplements or fortified foods  
- Older adults and those with GI disorders (Crohn’s, celiac, bariatric surgery) should monitor levels regularly  
- Avoid excessive alcohol intake, which can worsen deficiency  

**Case Studies:**

Case 1 Input: B12 = 350 pg/mL (male, 35 years old) Output: Normal. Recommendation: Maintain balanced diet.

Case 2 Input: B12 = 180 pg/mL (female, 40 years old) Output: Low, possible early deficiency. Recommendation: Supplementation and further tests (MMA, homocysteine).

Case 3 Input: B12 = 120 pg/mL (male, 55 years old, fatigue + neuropathy) Output: Deficient, consistent with B12 deficiency anemia. Recommendation: Intramuscular B12 injections, monitor recovery.

Case 4 Input: B12 = 600 pg/mL (female, 25 years old) Output: Normal. Recommendation: Continue healthy diet.

Case 5 Input: B12 = 220 pg/mL (male, 60 years old, vegan) Output: Borderline. Recommendation: Supplementation advised, dietary adjustments.  
  
Case 6 Input: B12 = 950 pg/mL (female, 70 years old, taking supplements) Output: Slightly above normal, usually safe if supplement-related. Recommendation: Reduce supplementation dosage.  

Case 7 Input: B12 = 160 pg/mL (male, 45 years old, pernicious anemia history) Output: Deficiency confirmed. Recommendation: Lifelong B12 injections required.  

Case 8 Input: B12 = 280 pg/mL (female, 30 years old, pregnant) Output: Borderline. Recommendation: Prenatal vitamins and B12 supplementation.  

Case 9 Input: B12 = 800 pg/mL (male, 50 years old) Output: Normal-high. Recommendation: Monitor if not supplementing, check liver/kidney if persistent.  

Case 10 Input: B12 = 150 pg/mL (female, 65 years old, memory loss) Output: Deficient, may contribute to cognitive decline. Recommendation: IM B12 therapy, neurologist follow-up.  

Case 11 Input: B12 = 250 pg/mL (male, 20 years old, vegetarian) Output: Borderline. Recommendation: Oral B12 supplements.  

Case 12 Input: B12 = 100 pg/mL (female, 55 years old, severe anemia) Output: Severe deficiency with megaloblastic anemia. Recommendation: Urgent B12 therapy, hematology follow-up.  

Case 13 Input: B12 = 720 pg/mL (male, 32 years old, on supplements) Output: High-normal. Recommendation: Continue current regimen.  
 
Case 14 Input: B12 = 400 pg/mL (female, 28 years old) Output: Normal. Recommendation: Maintain healthy diet.  

Case 15 Input: B12 = 180 pg/mL (male, 80 years old) Output: Low, elderly at higher risk due to absorption issues. Recommendation: Oral or IM supplementation.  

Case 16 Input: B12 = 310 pg/mL (female, 22 years old, vegan athlete) Output: Low-normal. Recommendation: Regular supplementation.  

Case 17 Input: B12 = 850 pg/mL (male, 65 years old, liver disease) Output: High due to liver dysfunction. Recommendation: Manage underlying liver condition.  

Case 18 Input: B12 = 260 pg/mL (female, 35 years old, mild fatigue) Output: Borderline. Recommendation: Supplement and retest.  

Case 19 Input: B12 = 90 pg/mL (male, 70 years old, neuropathy + gait issues) Output: Severe deficiency. Recommendation: Immediate IM therapy, long-term supplementation.  

Case 20 Input: B12 = 500 pg/mL (female, 15 years old) Output: Normal. Recommendation: Balanced nutrition.  

Case 21 Input: B12 = 140 pg/mL (male, 60 years old, GI surgery history) Output: Deficiency due to malabsorption. Recommendation: Lifelong injections.  

Case 22 Input: B12 = 275 pg/mL (female, 45 years old, hypothyroid) Output: Borderline. Recommendation: Monitor and supplement as needed.  

Case 23 Input: B12 = 640 pg/mL (male, 25 years old, athlete using multivitamins) Output: Normal. Recommendation: No concerns.  

Case 24 Input: B12 = 200 pg/mL (female, 50 years old, chronic alcoholism) Output: Deficient due to poor absorption + nutrition. Recommendation: IM therapy + alcohol cessation support.
Case 25 Input: 12 = 1100 pg/mL (male, 40 years old, unexplained) Output: Very high, not due to supplementation. May indicate liver or blood disorder. Recommendation: Further evaluation (liver tests, hematology referral).
