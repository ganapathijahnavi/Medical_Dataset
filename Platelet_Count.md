# Platelet Count (Plt)

**Normal Range:**  
150,000 – 450,000 platelets per microliter (µL)  

**Clinical Significance:**  
Platelets (thrombocytes) are essential for **blood clotting and wound healing**.  
- **Low platelets (thrombocytopenia):** Increases bleeding risk, bruising, or delayed clotting.  
- **High platelets (thrombocytosis):** May increase risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.  

**Future Diseases:**  
- Thrombocytopenia (immune disorders, infections, drug reactions)  
- Thrombocythemia (bone marrow overproduction of platelets)  
- Leukemia or other bone marrow disorders  
- Secondary changes due to infection, chronic inflammation, or cancer
- 
**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid injury and activities with high bleeding risk if platelets are low  
- Limit alcohol intake (which lowers platelet production)  
- Monitor medications (e.g., aspirin, anticoagulants) affecting platelet function  
- Regular medical follow-up if counts are persistently abnormal  

## Case Studies

Case 1 Input: Platelets = 120,000/µL (male, 35 years old) Output: Mild thrombocytopenia. May be due to viral infection, medications, or early bone marrow disorder. Avoid injury and consult a doctor.

Case 2 Input: Platelets = 250,000/µL (female, 28 years old) Output: Normal platelet count. Maintain balanced lifestyle.

Case 3 Input: Platelets = 500,000/µL (male, 45 years old) Output: Thrombocytosis, possible bone marrow disorder (essential thrombocythemia) or secondary to inflammation. Hematology evaluation needed.

Case 4 Input: Platelets = 90,000/µL (female, 50 years old) Output: Moderate thrombocytopenia. Risk of bleeding. Possible causes: immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), liver disease, or medications.

Case 5 Input: Platelets = 160,000/µL (male, 60 years old) Output: Lower end of normal. Monitor if trend continues.

Case 6 Input: Platelets = 600,000/µL (female, 30 years old) Output: Marked thrombocytosis. Could be primary (bone marrow disease) or reactive (infection, inflammation). Further tests required.

Case 7 Input: Platelets = 200,000/µL (child, 8 years old, male) Output: Normal count for age. Healthy diet and routine checkups advised.

Case 8 Input: Platelets = 80,000/µL (infant, 1 year old) Output: Low platelet count. Could be post-viral thrombocytopenia or congenital. Pediatric evaluation required.

Case 9 Input: Platelets = 470,000/µL (male, 30 years old, smoker) Output: Slightly high, could be reactive to smoking, inflammation, or dehydration. Repeat test recommended.

Case 10 Input: Platelets = 140,000/µL (female, 65 years old) Output: Slightly below normal. Risk of mild bleeding. Rule out liver disease, vitamin deficiencies, or bone marrow issues.

Case 11 Input: Platelets = 50,000/µL (male, 40 years old, on chemotherapy) Output: Severe thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy. High bleeding risk. Requires medical intervention.

Case 12 Input: Platelets = 300,000/µL (female, 22 years old, pregnant) Output: Normal platelet count. No concerns. Monitor for gestational thrombocytopenia.

Case 13 Input: Platelets = 100,000/µL (male, 18 years old, athlete) Output: Mild thrombocytopenia, possibly from viral illness or nutritional deficiency. Monitor trends.

Case 14 Input: Platelets = 220,000/µL (female, 45 years old, vegetarian) Output: Normal. Balanced diet and lifestyle recommended.

Case 15 Input: Platelets = 700,000/µL (male, 70 years old) Output: Very high count. May indicate myeloproliferative disorder. Hematology evaluation essential.

Case 16 Input: Platelets = 180,000/µL (child, 5 years old, female) Output: Normal platelet count. Routine pediatric care sufficient.

Case 17 Input: Platelets = 75,000/µL (female, 35 years old, heavy menstrual bleeding) Output: Low count increases bleeding risk. Possible immune or nutritional cause. Immediate medical attention advised.

Case 18 Input: Platelets = 400,000/µL (male, 25 years old, living at high altitude) Output: Upper-normal. Could be a physiological response to altitude. Monitor hydration and repeat test if symptoms occur.

Case 19 Input: Platelets = 460,000/µL (female, 55 years old) Output: Slightly above normal. Could be reactive (infection, inflammation) or early thrombocythemia. Further workup needed.

Case 20 Input: Platelets = 130,000/µL (male, 30 years old, thalassemia trait) Output: Low-normal. May be secondary to underlying condition. Monitor counts regularly.

Case 21 Input: Platelets = 210,000/µL (infant, 6 months old) Output: Normal range for infant. No issues.

Case 22 Input: Platelets = 520,000/µL (female, 40 years old, autoimmune disorder) Output: Elevated count, possibly reactive to autoimmune inflammation. Monitor closely.

Case 23 Input: Platelets = 95,000/µL (male, 50 years old, chronic kidney disease) Output: Low platelet count common in CKD. Monitor for bleeding. Medical management required.

Case 24 Input: Platelets = 610,000/µL (female, 70 years old, cancer history) Output: High platelet count, may be paraneoplastic or treatment-related. Hematology follow-up essential.
Case 25 Input: Platelets = 145,000/µL (male, 45 years old, smoker) Output: Slightly below normal. Smoking and nutritional deficiencies may contribute. Lifestyle modification advised.
