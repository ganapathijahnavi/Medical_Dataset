# Platelet Count (Plt)

**Normal Range:**  
150,000 – 450,000 platelets per microliter (µL)  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Platelets (thrombocytes) are essential for **blood clotting and wound healing**.  
- **Low platelets (thrombocytopenia):** Increases bleeding risk, bruising, or delayed clotting.  
- **High platelets (thrombocytosis):** May increase risk of blood clots, stroke, or heart attack.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Thrombocytopenia (immune disorders, infections, drug reactions)  
- Thrombocythemia (bone marrow overproduction of platelets)  
- Leukemia or other bone marrow disorders  
- Secondary changes due to infection, chronic inflammation, or cancer  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid injury and activities with high bleeding risk if platelets are low  
- Limit alcohol intake (which lowers platelet production)  
- Monitor medications (e.g., aspirin, anticoagulants) affecting platelet function  
- Regular medical follow-up if counts are persistently abnormal

## Case Interpretations

### Case 1  
**Input:** Platelets = 120,000/µL (male, 35 years old)  
**Output:** Mild thrombocytopenia. May be due to viral infection, medications, or early bone marrow disorder. Avoid injury and consult a doctor.  

### Case 2  
**Input:** Platelets = 250,000/µL (female, 28 years old)  
**Output:** Normal platelet count. Maintain balanced lifestyle.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** Platelets = 500,000/µL (male, 45 years old)  
**Output:** Thrombocytosis, possible bone marrow disorder (essential thrombocythemia) or secondary to inflammation. Hematology evaluation needed.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** Platelets = 90,000/µL (female, 50 years old)  
**Output:** Moderate thrombocytopenia. Risk of bleeding. Possible causes: immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), liver disease, or medications.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** Platelets = 160,000/µL (male, 60 years old)  
**Output:** Lower end of normal. Monitor if trend continues.  

### Case 6  
**Input:** Platelets = 600,000/µL (female, 30 years old)  
**Output:** Marked thrombocytosis. Could be primary (bone marrow disease) or reactive (infection, inflammation). Further tests required.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** Platelets = 200,000/µL (child, 8 years old, male)  
**Output:** Normal count for age. Healthy diet and routine checkups advised.  

### Case 8  
**Input:** Platelets = 80,000/µL (infant, 1 year old)  
**Output:** Low platelet count. Could be post-viral thrombocytopenia or congenital. Pediatric evaluation required.  

### Case 9  
**Input:** Platelets = 470,000/µL (male, 30 years old, smoker)  
**Output:** Slightly high, could be reactive to smoking, inflammation, or dehydration. Repeat test recommended.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** Platelets = 140,000/µL (female, 65 years old)  
**Output:** Slightly below normal. Risk of mild bleeding. Rule out liver disease, vitamin deficiencies, or bone marrow issues.  

### Case 11  
**Input:** Platelets = 50,000/µL (male, 40 years old, on chemotherapy)  
**Output:** Severe thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy. High bleeding risk. Requires medical intervention.  

### Case 12  
**Input:** Platelets = 300,000/µL (female, 22 years old, pregnant)  
**Output:** Normal platelet count. No concerns. Monitor for gestational thrombocytopenia.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** Platelets = 100,000/µL (male, 18 years old, athlete)  
**Output:** Mild thrombocytopenia, possibly from viral illness or nutritional deficiency. Monitor trends.  

### Case 14  
**Input:** Platelets = 220,000/µL (female, 45 years old, vegetarian)  
**Output:** Normal. Balanced diet and lifestyle recommended.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** Platelets = 700,000/µL (male, 70 years old)  
**Output:** Very high count. May indicate myeloproliferative disorder. Hematology evaluation essential.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** Platelets = 180,000/µL (child, 5 years old, female)  
**Output:** Normal platelet count. Routine pediatric care sufficient.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** Platelets = 75,000/µL (female, 35 years old, heavy menstrual bleeding)  
**Output:** Low count increases bleeding risk. Possible immune or nutritional cause. Immediate medical attention advised.  

### Case 18  
**Input:** Platelets = 400,000/µL (male, 25 years old, living at high altitude)  
**Output:** Upper-normal. Could be a physiological response to altitude. Monitor hydration and repeat test if symptoms occur.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** Platelets = 460,000/µL (female, 55 years old)  
**Output:** Slightly above normal. Could be reactive (infection, inflammation) or early thrombocythemia. Further workup needed.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** Platelets = 130,000/µL (male, 30 years old, thalassemia trait)  
**Output:** Low-normal. May be secondary to underlying condition. Monitor counts regularly.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** Platelets = 210,000/µL (infant, 6 months old)  
**Output:** Normal range for infant. No issues.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** Platelets = 520,000/µL (female, 40 years old, autoimmune disorder)  
**Output:** Elevated count, possibly reactive to autoimmune inflammation. Monitor closely.  

### Case 23  
**Input:** Platelets = 95,000/µL (male, 50 years old, chronic kidney disease)
