# Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

**Normal Range:**  
11.5% – 14.5%

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
RDW measures the variation in size of red blood cells (anisocytosis).  
- **High RDW** → suggests mixed population of small and large RBCs, often seen in nutritional anemias or bone marrow disorders.  
- **Normal RDW** → uniform RBC size, useful in classifying types of anemia.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Iron-deficiency anemia  
- Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency  
- Hemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia)  
- Chronic liver disease  
- Bone marrow disorders  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Ensure balanced diet with iron, B12, and folate  
- Regular health checkups if chronically abnormal  
- Manage underlying chronic diseases  
- Follow physician’s advice for supplementation or treatment

## Case Interpretations

### Case 1  
**Input:** RDW = 12.5%  
**Output:** Normal. RBCs are uniform in size. No concern.  

### Case 2  
**Input:** RDW = 14.0%  
**Output:** Normal, upper end. Consistent with stable red cell population.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** RDW = 15.5%, low MCV  
**Output:** Elevated RDW with low MCV suggests iron-deficiency anemia.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** RDW = 16.2%, high MCV  
**Output:** Increased RDW with high MCV suggests vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** RDW = 11.8%  
**Output:** Normal. No signs of anisocytosis.  

### Case 6  
**Input:** RDW = 18.0%, normal MCV  
**Output:** High RDW with normal MCV may suggest early iron deficiency or mixed anemia.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** RDW = 20%, patient with fatigue  
**Output:** Very high RDW. Strongly suggests nutritional anemia (iron or B12/folate).  

### Case 8  
**Input:** RDW = 13.0%  
**Output:** Normal. No abnormal variation in RBC size.  

### Case 9  
**Input:** RDW = 15.0%, child, pale  
**Output:** Elevated. Likely iron-deficiency anemia in pediatric patient.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** RDW = 12.2%  
**Output:** Normal. Stable red cell size.  

### Case 11  
**Input:** RDW = 19%, alcoholic patient  
**Output:** High RDW, consistent with macrocytosis from alcohol-related folate deficiency.  

### Case 12  
**Input:** RDW = 17.2%, elderly male  
**Output:** Elevated, consider anemia of chronic disease or mixed deficiency.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** RDW = 12.7%, stable labs  
**Output:** Normal. No anemia suggested.  

### Case 14  
**Input:** RDW = 16.5%, pregnant female  
**Output:** Elevated. Could suggest iron deficiency common in pregnancy.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** RDW = 13.2%  
**Output:** Normal. No abnormalities.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** RDW = 21%, very high  
**Output:** Critically elevated. Suggests severe nutritional anemia or bone marrow disease.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** RDW = 14.5%  
**Output:** Upper normal limit. Monitor if symptoms arise.  

### Case 18  
**Input:** RDW = 11.6%  
**Output:** Normal, low end. No concern.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** RDW = 15.7%, thalassemia trait suspected  
**Output:** Elevated, but thalassemia trait often has normal RDW with low MCV. Further testing needed.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** RDW = 18.5%, chronic liver disease  
**Output:** Elevated. Consistent with liver-related RBC abnormalities.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** RDW = 12.9%  
**Output:** Normal. Healthy range.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** RDW = 17%, post-chemo patient  
**Output:** Elevated. Consistent with bone marrow recovery/abnormal production.  

### Case 23  
**Input:** RDW = 14.8%, borderline  
**Output:** Slightly high. Monitor for early anemia development.  

### Case 24  
**Input:** RDW = 22%, severe fatigue  
**Output:** Very high. Severe iron deficiency or megaloblastic anemia suspected.  

### Case 25  
**Input:** RDW = 12.0%  
**Output:** Normal. No significant variation in RBC size.
