# Uric Acid

**Normal Range:**  
Men: 3.4 – 7.0 mg/dL  
Women: 2.4 – 6.0 mg/dL  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Uric acid is a waste product from purine metabolism, excreted by the kidneys. Elevated levels may cause gout and kidney stones, while low levels may be linked to certain metabolic disorders.

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Gout  
- Uric acid kidney stones  
- Chronic kidney disease  
- Metabolic syndrome  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Limit purine-rich foods (red meat, organ meats, seafood)  
- Reduce alcohol (especially beer)  
- Maintain hydration  
- Weight management and exercise  
- Medications (allopurinol, febuxostat) if recurrent gout

## Case Interpretations (25 Cases)

### Case 1  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 4.5 mg/dL, healthy adult male  
**Output:** Normal. No intervention needed.  

### Case 2  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 3.0 mg/dL, healthy adult female  
**Output:** Normal range. Continue healthy lifestyle.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 2.0 mg/dL, malnourished patient  
**Output:** Low uric acid. May suggest poor nutrition or liver disease.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 7.2 mg/dL, asymptomatic male  
**Output:** Slightly high. Monitor; lifestyle changes may help.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 8.5 mg/dL, obese patient  
**Output:** Hyperuricemia. At risk for gout and metabolic syndrome.  

### Case 6  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 9.0 mg/dL, hypertensive patient  
**Output:** High. Strong link with cardiovascular and renal risks.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 10.2 mg/dL, joint pain present  
**Output:** Likely gout. Requires medical treatment.  

### Case 8  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 11.0 mg/dL, renal stone history  
**Output:** Severe hyperuricemia. High risk of kidney stones.  

### Case 9  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 12.5 mg/dL, chronic kidney disease patient  
**Output:** Very high. Impaired renal excretion. Needs nephrology care.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 6.8 mg/dL, borderline  
**Output:** Upper normal. Monitor diet and hydration.  

### Case 11  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 7.5 mg/dL, heavy alcohol consumption  
**Output:** Elevated. Alcohol is a major contributor. Reduce intake.  

### Case 12  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 5.0 mg/dL, diabetic patient  
**Output:** Normal, but needs ongoing monitoring due to metabolic risk.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 2.5 mg/dL, liver cirrhosis  
**Output:** Low. Possibly due to impaired purine metabolism.  

### Case 14  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 8.0 mg/dL, chemotherapy patient  
**Output:** Elevated. Could indicate tumor lysis syndrome.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 9.8 mg/dL, young male with swollen toe  
**Output:** Gouty arthritis (classic podagra). Urgent therapy required.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 6.2 mg/dL, female with no symptoms  
**Output:** Normal. Continue balanced lifestyle.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 11.5 mg/dL, hypertension + CKD  
**Output:** Dangerous level. Needs urate-lowering drugs.  

### Case 18  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 7.1 mg/dL, elderly male  
**Output:** Slightly elevated. Monitor joints and renal health.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 5.8 mg/dL, pregnant woman  
**Output:** Normal. Elevated levels in pregnancy can suggest preeclampsia.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 3.2 mg/dL, malabsorption syndrome  
**Output:** Low. May indicate nutritional deficiency.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 14.0 mg/dL, advanced renal failure  
**Output:** Severe. Dialysis or strong medication needed.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 6.0 mg/dL, on uric acid-lowering drugs  
**Output:** Controlled. Continue therapy.  

### Case 23  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 8.8 mg/dL, high red meat intake  
**Output:** Diet-related hyperuricemia. Dietary modification needed.  

### Case 24  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 7.6 mg/dL, postmenopausal woman  
**Output:** Elevated. Risk of gout increases after menopause.  

### Case 25  
**Input:** Uric Acid = 10.5 mg/dL, recurrent kidney stones  
**Output:** Severe hyperuricemia. High risk of uric acid nephrolithiasis. Preventive therapy required.
