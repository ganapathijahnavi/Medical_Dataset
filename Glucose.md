# Glucose

**Normal Range (Fasting):**  
70 – 110 mg/dL  
- Prediabetes: 100 – 125 mg/dL  
- Diabetes: ≥ 126 mg/dL (on two separate tests)  
- Hypoglycemia: < 70 mg/dL  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Glucose is the body’s **primary energy source**, regulated by insulin and other hormones.  
- Elevated fasting glucose suggests **diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome**.  
- Low glucose indicates **hypoglycemia**, which can be life-threatening if severe.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1, Type 2)  
- Hypoglycemia (due to medications, hormonal imbalance, or insulin overproduction)  
- Metabolic syndrome  
- Cardiovascular disease  
- Diabetic complications (neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain a balanced diet low in refined sugars and high in fiber  
- Regular exercise to improve insulin sensitivity  
- Avoid excessive alcohol and processed foods  
- Monitor glucose if at risk (family history, obesity, hypertension)  
- Follow medical treatment plans if diabetic

# Case Studies 

### Case 1  
**Input:** Glucose = 90 mg/dL (male, 25 years old, healthy)  
**Output:** Normal fasting glucose. Maintain healthy lifestyle.  

---

### Case 2  
**Input:** Glucose = 105 mg/dL (female, 40 years old, no symptoms)  
**Output:** Prediabetic range. Lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) recommended to prevent diabetes.  

---

### Case 3  
**Input:** Glucose = 130 mg/dL (male, 50 years old, overweight)  
**Output:** Elevated. Possible diabetes. Further testing (HbA1c, repeat fasting glucose) required.  

---

### Case 4  
**Input:** Glucose = 65 mg/dL (female, 30 years old, dizziness, sweating)

---

### Case 5  
**Input:** Glucose = 200 mg/dL (male, 60 years old, random test)
