# Glucose

**Normal Range (Fasting):**  
70 – 110 mg/dL  
- Prediabetes: 100 – 125 mg/dL  
- Diabetes: ≥ 126 mg/dL (on two separate tests)  
- Hypoglycemia: < 70 mg/dL  


**Clinical Significance:**  
Glucose is the body’s **primary energy source**, regulated by insulin and other hormones.  
- Elevated fasting glucose suggests **diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome**.  
- Low glucose indicates **hypoglycemia**, which can be life-threatening if severe.  


**Future Diseases:**  
- Diabetes Mellitus (Type 1, Type 2)  
- Hypoglycemia (due to medications, hormonal imbalance, or insulin overproduction)  
- Metabolic syndrome  
- Cardiovascular disease  
- Diabetic complications (neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy)  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain a balanced diet low in refined sugars and high in fiber  
- Regular exercise to improve insulin sensitivity  
- Avoid excessive alcohol and processed foods  
- Monitor glucose if at risk (family history, obesity, hypertension)  
- Follow medical treatment plans if diabetic  


**Case Studies:**
Case 1

Input: Glucose = 90 mg/dL (male, 25 years old, healthy)
Output: Normal fasting glucose. Maintain healthy lifestyle.

Case 2

Input: Glucose = 105 mg/dL (female, 40 years old, no symptoms)
Output: Prediabetic range. Lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) recommended to prevent diabetes.

Case 3

Input: Glucose = 130 mg/dL (male, 50 years old, overweight)
Output: Elevated. Possible diabetes. Further testing (HbA1c, repeat fasting glucose) required.

Case 4

Input: Glucose = 65 mg/dL (female, 30 years old, dizziness, sweating)
Output: Hypoglycemia. Immediate glucose intake recommended. Investigate causes.

Case 5

Input: Glucose = 200 mg/dL (male, 60 years old, random test)
Output: High glucose, possible diabetes. Needs confirmation with fasting glucose or HbA1c.

Case 6

Input: Glucose = 75 mg/dL (child, 8 years old, healthy)
Output: Normal glucose for age. No concerns.

Case 7

Input: Glucose = 98 mg/dL (female, 35 years old, pregnant, fasting)
Output: Normal. Continue routine monitoring for gestational diabetes.

Case 8

Input: Glucose = 118 mg/dL (male, 45 years old, family history of diabetes)
Output: Prediabetic range. High risk due to family history. Lifestyle changes essential.

Case 9

Input: Glucose = 250 mg/dL (female, 55 years old, symptoms of frequent urination and thirst)
Output: Strongly suggestive of diabetes. Immediate medical care required.

Case 10

Input: Glucose = 140 mg/dL (male, 70 years old, after meal)
Output: Normal postprandial glucose. No issues.

Case 11

Input: Glucose = 40 mg/dL (female, 20 years old, on insulin therapy)
Output: Severe hypoglycemia. Emergency glucose needed. Review insulin dosing.

Case 12

Input: Glucose = 160 mg/dL (male, 30 years old, random test after meal)
Output: Mildly elevated postprandial glucose. Monitor and assess HbA1c.

Case 13

Input: Glucose = 100 mg/dL (female, 28 years old, healthy)
Output: Borderline normal. Lifestyle measures to keep stable.

Case 14

Input: Glucose = 72 mg/dL (male, 45 years old, fasting, no symptoms)
Output: Normal. No issues.

Case 15

Input: Glucose = 400 mg/dL (female, 65 years old, diabetic, confused and weak)
Output: Critically high glucose. Possible hyperosmolar crisis. Emergency care required.

Case 16

Input: Glucose = 85 mg/dL (child, 5 years old, healthy)
Output: Normal. No concerns.

Case 17

Input: Glucose = 125 mg/dL (male, 35 years old, overweight)
Output: Upper prediabetic limit. Very high risk of diabetes. Weight loss and monitoring essential.

Case 18

Input: Glucose = 300 mg/dL (female, 40 years old, known diabetic, poorly controlled)
Output: High glucose. Indicates poor diabetes control. Adjust medication and lifestyle.

Case 19

Input: Glucose = 55 mg/dL (male, 60 years old, fasting, on sulfonylurea)
Output: Hypoglycemia due to medication. Requires adjustment of therapy.

Case 20

Input: Glucose = 92 mg/dL (female, 18 years old, healthy athlete)
Output: Normal fasting glucose. Maintain balanced diet.

Case 21

Input: Glucose = 180 mg/dL (male, 70 years old, post-meal)
Output: Elevated postprandial glucose. Suggests impaired glucose tolerance. Monitor and adjust diet.

Case 22

Input: Glucose = 82 mg/dL (female, 65 years old, hypertension, routine test)
Output: Normal fasting glucose. Continue healthy lifestyle.

Case 23

Input: Glucose = 150 mg/dL (male, 45 years old, after surgery, on steroids)
Output: Steroid-induced hyperglycemia. Monitor and manage blood sugar.

Case 24

Input: Glucose = 110 mg/dL (female, 50 years old, overweight)
Output: Upper normal. Lifestyle measures required to prevent prediabetes.

Case 25

Input: Glucose = 500 mg/dL (male, 55 years old, diabetic with dehydration)
Output: Extremely high glucose. Suggests diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar state. Emergency care required.
