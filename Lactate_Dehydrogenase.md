# Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)

**Normal Range:**  
100 â€“ 190 U/L (may vary slightly by lab)

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme found in almost all body tissues (heart, liver, muscles, kidneys, lungs, and blood cells).  
- **Elevated LDH** indicates cell or tissue damage but is non-specific.  
- It is often used as a **supportive marker** along with other tests to identify conditions such as **hemolysis, myocardial infarction, liver disease, muscle injury, and cancers**.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Hemolytic anemia  
- Myocardial infarction  
- Liver diseases (hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer)  
- Muscle disorders (rhabdomyolysis, muscular dystrophy)  
- Certain cancers (lymphoma, leukemia, testicular cancer)  
- Lung diseases (pulmonary embolism, pneumonia)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- **Seek medical evaluation** for persistent elevation  
- **Manage underlying conditions** (e.g., liver, heart, muscle health)  
- Avoid excessive **alcohol use** and **toxic substances**  
- **Regular monitoring** if at risk for chronic diseases

# Case Studies

### Case 1  
**Input:** LDH = 150 U/L (male, 35 years, healthy)  
**Output:** Normal LDH. No concerns.  

---

### Case 2  
**Input:** LDH = 220 U/L (female, 40 years, mild muscle soreness after workout)  
**Output:** Slightly elevated, likely due to muscle strain. Monitor, not alarming.  

---

### Case 3  
**Input:** LDH = 600 U/L (male, 50 years, jaundice, history of hepatitis)  
**Output:** Markedly elevated. Suggestive of liver disease progression. Requires further liver panel tests.  

---

### Case 4  
**Input:** LDH = 350 U/L (female, 60 years, shortness of breath, chest pain)  
**Output:** Elevated LDH with symptoms may suggest myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. Urgent evaluation required.  

---

### Case 5  
**Input:** LDH = 180 U/L (male, 28 years, healthy athlete)  
**Output:** Normal LDH. No concern.  

---

### Case 6  
**Input:** LDH = 420 U/L (female, 30 years, chemotherapy for lymphoma)  
**Output:** Elevated LDH, common in active cancer and chemotherapy response. Needs close oncology follow-up.  

---

### Case 7  
**Input:** LDH = 280 U/L (male, 70 years, with anemia)  
**Output:** Elevated LDH with anemia may suggest **hemolytic anemia**. Hematology referral needed.  

---

### Case 8  
**Input:** LDH = 195 U/L (female, 45 years, mild fatigue)  
**Output:** Slightly above normal, not specific. Further testing may be warranted.  

---

### Case 9  
**Input:** LDH = 900 U/L (male, 65 years, testicular cancer)  
**Output:** Very high LDH, often used as a **tumor marker** in testicular cancer. Requires oncology management.  

---

### Case 10  
**Input:** LDH = 145 U/L (female, 20 years, healthy)  
**Output:** Normal LDH. No issues.  

---

### Case 11  
**Input:** LDH = 310 U/L (male, 55 years, chronic alcohol use)  
**Output:** Elevated LDH, possible alcoholic liver disease. Liver panel recommended.  

---

### Case 12  
**Input:** LDH = 275 U/L (female, 35 years, shortness of breath, pneumonia diagnosis)  
**Output:** Elevated LDH consistent with tissue injury from lung infection. Supportive finding.  

---

### Case 13  
**Input:** LDH = 510 U/L (male, 42 years, sickle cell anemia)  
**Output:** High LDH, consistent with chronic hemolysis. Requires ongoing hematology management.  

---

### Case 14  
**Input:** LDH = 165 U/L (female, 29 years, pregnant, routine labs)  
**Output:** Normal LDH. No concerns.  

---

### Case 15  
**Input:** LDH = 480 U/L (male, 75 years, heart failure)  
**Output:** Elevated LDH due to cardiac stress and tissue hypoxia. Cardiology follow-up needed.  

---

### Case 16  
**Input:** LDH = 200 U/L (female, 50 years, borderline obesity, no symptoms)  
**Output:** Slightly elevated. Could be lab variation. Recommend monitoring.  

---

### Case 17  
**Input:** LDH = 650 U/L (male, 60 years, chest pain, abnormal ECG)  
**Output:** High LDH, possible myocardial infarction. Needs urgent cardiology evaluation.  

---

### Case 18  
**Input:** LDH = 170 U/L (female, 8 years old, healthy child)  
**Output:** Normal LDH. No issues.  

---

### Case 19  
**Input:** LDH = 240 U/L (male, 35 years, recent COVID-19 infection)  
**Output:** Mild elevation. LDH is often elevated in viral pneumonia and lung injury. Monitor recovery.  

---

### Case 20  
**Input:** LDH = 720 U/L (female, 65 years, with lymphoma relapse)  
**Output:** Very high LDH, marker of active disease. Oncology intervention required.  

---

### Case 21  
**Input:** LDH = 158 U/L (male, 22 years, routine checkup)  
**Output:** Normal. No further action required.
