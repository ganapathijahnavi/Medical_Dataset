# Hematocrit (Hct)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Men (adult):** 41.5% – 50.4%  
- **Women (adult):** 36.9% – 44.6%  
- **Pregnant women:** > 33% (lower due to hemodilution)  
- **Children (6–12 years):** 35% – 45%  
- **Infants (6 months–1 year):** 33% – 39%  
- **Newborns (0–1 month):** 45% – 61%

**Clinical Significance:**  
Hematocrit measures the percentage of blood volume made up of red blood cells.  
- **Low hematocrit:** Indicates anemia, blood loss, nutritional deficiency, or chronic illness.  
- **High hematocrit:** May suggest dehydration, chronic hypoxia, or polycythemia vera.  
- **Hct is usually interpreted alongside hemoglobin and RBC count.**  

---

**Future Diseases & Risks of Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Low Hematocrit:**  
  - Iron deficiency anemia  
  - Vitamin B12/folate deficiency  
  - Chronic kidney disease  
  - Bone marrow suppression  
  - Blood loss (GI bleeding, trauma, heavy menstruation)  
- **High Hematocrit:**  
  - Polycythemia vera  
  - Dehydration  
  - COPD, chronic hypoxia, high altitude adaptation  
  - Heart disease or congenital cyanotic conditions  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain hydration  
- Eat a diet rich in iron, B12, and folate  
- Avoid smoking and alcohol abuse  
- Exercise regularly but avoid overexertion in high hematocrit states  
- Seek medical evaluation for persistent abnormal values

**Recommendation:** Monitor hydration, no intervention if asymptomatic.  

---

### Case 6  
**Input:** Hct = 33% (female, 22 years old, pregnant)
