# Hematocrit (Hct)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Men (adult):** 41.5% – 50.4%  
- **Women (adult):** 36.9% – 44.6%  
- **Pregnant women:** > 33% (lower due to hemodilution)  
- **Children (6–12 years):** 35% – 45%  
- **Infants (6 months–1 year):** 33% – 39%  
- **Newborns (0–1 month):** 45% – 61%  


**Clinical Significance:**  
Hematocrit measures the percentage of blood volume made up of red blood cells.  
- **Low hematocrit:** Indicates anemia, blood loss, nutritional deficiency, or chronic illness.  
- **High hematocrit:** May suggest dehydration, chronic hypoxia, or polycythemia vera.  
- **Hct is usually interpreted alongside hemoglobin and RBC count.**  

**Future Diseases & Risks of Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Low Hematocrit:**  
  - Iron deficiency anemia  
  - Vitamin B12/folate deficiency  
  - Chronic kidney disease  
  - Bone marrow suppression  
  - Blood loss (GI bleeding, trauma, heavy menstruation)  
- **High Hematocrit:**  
  - Polycythemia vera  
  - Dehydration  
  - COPD, chronic hypoxia, high altitude adaptation  
  - Heart disease or congenital cyanotic conditions  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain hydration  
- Eat a diet rich in iron, B12, and folate  
- Avoid smoking and alcohol abuse  
- Exercise regularly but avoid overexertion in high hematocrit states  
- Seek medical evaluation for persistent abnormal values  


**Case Studies:**

Case 1

Input: Hct = 35% (male, 30 years old)
Output: Low hematocrit for an adult male, likely anemia or blood loss.
Recommendation: Check iron and B12 levels, consult a physician.

Case 2

Input: Hct = 43% (female, 25 years old)
Output: Within normal range for adult female.
Recommendation: Maintain balanced diet, regular checkups.

Case 3

Input: Hct = 52% (male, 50 years old)
Output: Elevated, may indicate dehydration or polycythemia.
Recommendation: Ensure hydration, further evaluation advised.

Case 4

Input: Hct = 30% (female, 60 years old)
Output: Low, consistent with anemia.
Recommendation: Increase iron intake, rule out GI bleeding.

Case 5

Input: Hct = 49% (male, 25 years old, athlete)
Output: High-normal, common in endurance athletes due to oxygen demand.
Recommendation: Monitor hydration, no intervention if asymptomatic.

Case 6

Input: Hct = 33% (female, 22 years old, pregnant)
Output: Slightly low but expected during pregnancy due to hemodilution.
Recommendation: Ensure prenatal vitamins with iron & folate.

Case 7

Input: Hct = 38% (male child, 10 years old)
Output: Normal range for age.
Recommendation: Maintain a balanced diet.

Case 8

Input: Hct = 32% (infant, 8 months old)
Output: Slightly below normal, possible iron deficiency.
Recommendation: Pediatric evaluation, iron-rich diet.

Case 9

Input: Hct = 58% (male, 40 years old, living at high altitude)
Output: Elevated, but can be normal at high altitude.
Recommendation: Stay hydrated, monitor symptoms.

Case 10

Input: Hct = 34% (female, 70 years old)
Output: Low, possible chronic disease or nutritional deficiency.
Recommendation: Evaluate iron, kidney, and bone marrow function.

Case 11

Input: Hct = 60% (newborn, 2 days old)
Output: Upper limit of normal for newborns.
Recommendation: Monitor hydration and jaundice.

Case 12

Input: Hct = 28% (male, 65 years old, chronic kidney disease)
Output: Low, anemia of chronic disease likely.
Recommendation: Consider erythropoietin therapy, iron supplementation.

Case 13

Input: Hct = 36% (female, 45 years old, vegetarian)
Output: Low, possible nutritional anemia.
Recommendation: Ensure adequate B12 and iron intake.

Case 14

Input: Hct = 50% (male, 20 years old, athlete)
Output: Normal-high, physiological adaptation.
Recommendation: No intervention unless symptomatic.

Case 15

Input: Hct = 29% (female, 18 years old, heavy menstruation)
Output: Low, anemia due to blood loss likely.
Recommendation: Gynecological evaluation, iron therapy.

Case 16

Input: Hct = 55% (male, 55 years old, smoker)
Output: Elevated, likely secondary polycythemia from smoking.
Recommendation: Quit smoking, lung evaluation.

Case 17

Input: Hct = 31% (child, 9 years old, poor diet)
Output: Low, nutritional anemia.
Recommendation: Diet improvement, pediatric follow-up.

Case 18

Input: Hct = 40% (female, 65 years old)
Output: Within normal range.
Recommendation: Maintain healthy lifestyle.

Case 19

Input: Hct = 27% (male, 45 years old, post-surgery)
Output: Low due to surgical blood loss.
Recommendation: Iron therapy, monitor recovery.

Case 20

Input: Hct = 42% (female, 35 years old, diabetic)
Output: Normal.
Recommendation: Continue healthy lifestyle, manage diabetes.

Case 21

Input: Hct = 32% (female, 30 years old, pregnant with twins)
Output: Low, anemia common in multiple pregnancies.
Recommendation: Iron and folate supplementation, regular monitoring.

Case 22

Input: Hct = 54% (male, 70 years old, COPD)
Output: Elevated, due to chronic hypoxia.
Recommendation: Oxygen therapy, quit smoking.

Case 23

Input: Hct = 35% (female, 55 years old, hypothyroidism)
