# Calcium

**Normal Range:**  
- **Total Calcium:** 8.5 – 10.2 mg/dL  
- **Ionized Calcium (active form):** 4.6 – 5.3 mg/dL  

**Clinical Significance:**  
Calcium is crucial for **bone health, muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting**. Abnormal levels often reflect **parathyroid gland disorders, kidney disease, or vitamin D imbalance**.  

- **Hypocalcemia (low calcium):** Causes muscle cramps, tingling, seizures.  
- **Hypercalcemia (high calcium):** May cause kidney stones, fatigue, bone pain, psychiatric disturbances.  

**Future Diseases:**  
- **Hypocalcemia:**  
  - Vitamin D deficiency  
  - Hypoparathyroidism  
  - Chronic kidney disease  

- **Hypercalcemia:**  
  - Hyperparathyroidism  
  - Cancer-related bone disease  
  - Sarcoidosis  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Ensure **adequate calcium & vitamin D intake** (diet or supplements if prescribed)  
- Engage in **regular weight-bearing exercise**  
- Avoid **excessive calcium supplements** (risk of kidney stones)  
- Regular monitoring if you have **parathyroid, kidney, or bone disorders**
