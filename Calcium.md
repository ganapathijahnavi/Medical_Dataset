# Calcium

**Normal Range:**  
- **Total Calcium:** 8.5 – 10.2 mg/dL  
- **Ionized Calcium (active form):** 4.6 – 5.3 mg/dL  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Calcium is crucial for **bone health, muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting**. Abnormal levels often reflect **parathyroid gland disorders, kidney disease, or vitamin D imbalance**.  

- **Hypocalcemia (low calcium):** Causes muscle cramps, tingling, seizures.  
- **Hypercalcemia (high calcium):** May cause kidney stones, fatigue, bone pain, psychiatric disturbances.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- **Hypocalcemia:**  
  - Vitamin D deficiency  
  - Hypoparathyroidism  
  - Chronic kidney disease  

- **Hypercalcemia:**  
  - Hyperparathyroidism  
  - Cancer-related bone disease  
  - Sarcoidosis  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Ensure **adequate calcium & vitamin D intake** (diet or supplements if prescribed)  
- Engage in **regular weight-bearing exercise**  
- Avoid **excessive calcium supplements** (risk of kidney stones)  
- Regular monitoring if you have **parathyroid, kidney, or bone disorders**

# Case Studies 

### Case 1  
**Input:** Calcium = 9.5 mg/dL (male, 30 years old, healthy)  
**Output:** Normal. Continue balanced diet and healthy lifestyle.  

---

### Case 2  
**Input:** Calcium = 7.8 mg/dL (female, 25 years old, low vitamin D)  
**Output:** Low calcium, likely due to vitamin D deficiency. Recommend supplementation and sunlight exposure.  

---

### Case 3  
**Input:** Calcium = 11.2 mg/dL (male, 55 years old, hyperparathyroidism)  
**Output:** Elevated calcium, consistent with overactive parathyroid glands. Medical evaluation required.  

---

### Case 4  
**Input:** Calcium = 8.3 mg/dL (female, 60 years old, chronic kidney disease)  
**Output:** Low calcium due to kidney dysfunction. Requires nephrology follow-up.  

---

### Case 5  
**Input:** Calcium = 10.8 mg/dL (male, 70 years old, metastatic cancer)  
**Output:** Elevated calcium, possibly cancer-related hypercalcemia. Needs urgent oncology management.  

---

### Case 6  
**Input:** Calcium = 9.0 mg/dL (female, 28 years old, pregnant)  
**Output:** Normal calcium level during pregnancy. Continue balanced diet.  

---

### Case 7  
**Input:** Calcium = 7.5 mg/dL (male, 45 years old, post-thyroid surgery)  
**Output:** Hypocalcemia due to possible parathyroid injury. Needs calcium and vitamin D supplementation.  

---

### Case 8  
**Input:** Calcium = 10.1 mg/dL (female, 50 years old, healthy)
