# Zinc (Zn)

**Normal Range:**  
- Serum Zinc: 70 – 120 µg/dL  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Zinc is an essential trace element involved in immune function, wound healing, taste, growth, reproduction, and enzyme activity.  
- Low zinc → impaired immunity, delayed healing, stunted growth.  
- High zinc → rare, usually from supplements; may cause nausea, copper deficiency.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Zinc deficiency: growth retardation, poor wound healing, impaired immunity, skin disorders.  
- Excess zinc: copper deficiency, anemia, gastrointestinal issues.  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Eat zinc-rich foods (meat, shellfish, legumes, nuts, seeds).  
- Supplement only if deficient.  
- Avoid over-supplementation (> 40 mg/day).

# Case Interpretations

## Case 1  
**Input:** Zinc = 50 µg/dL, child with stunted growth  
**Output:** Deficiency → growth retardation.  

---

## Case 2  
**Input:** Zinc = 65 µg/dL, adult with frequent infections  
**Output:** Deficient → weak immunity.  

---

## Case 3  
**Input:** Zinc = 72 µg/dL, healthy adult  
**Output:** Low-normal → monitor diet.  

---

## Case 4  
**Input:** Zinc = 110 µg/dL, athlete with good nutrition  
**Output:** Normal.  

---

## Case 5  
**Input:** Zinc = 40 µg/dL, elderly with delayed wound healing  
**Output:** Severe deficiency. Supplement needed.  

---

## Case 6  
**Input:** Zinc = 95 µg/dL, teenager with acne  
**Output:** Normal. Zinc supplementation sometimes used in acne therapy.  

---

## Case 7  
**Input:** Zinc = 130 µg/dL, patient taking high-dose supplements  
**Output:** Mild excess. Risk of copper deficiency.  

---

## Case 8  
**Input:** Zinc = 75 µg/dL, vegetarian with fatigue  
**Output:** Normal but borderline → vegetarian diets may cause lower zinc bioavailability.  

---

**Output:** Deficient → may cause alopecia.  

---

## Case 10  
**Input:** Zinc = 85 µg/dL, pregnant woman  
**Output:** Normal. Adequate zinc essential for fetal development.  

---

## Case 11  
**Input:** Zinc = 48 µg/dL, patient with chronic diarrhea  
**Output:** Severe deficiency due to malabsorption.  

---

## Case 12  
**Input:** Zinc = 100 µg/dL, adult with balanced diet  
**Output:** Normal.  

---

## Case 13  
**Input:** Zinc = 68 µg/dL, diabetic patient with poor wound healing  
**Output:** Deficiency → contributes to delayed healing.  

---

## Case 14  
**Input:** Zinc = 77 µg/dL, office worker with mild fatigue  
**Output:** Low-normal. Lifestyle/diet improvement recommended.  

---

## Case 15  
**Input:** Zinc = 120 µg/dL, supplement user  
**Output:** Upper normal. Safe if monitored.  

---

## Case 16  
**Input:** Zinc = 45 µg/dL, child with frequent infections  
**Output:** Severe deficiency → weak immune system.  

---

## Case 17  
**Input:** Zinc = 80 µg/dL, elderly with taste disturbances  
**Output:** Normal but taste loss may suggest marginal deficiency.  

---

## Case 18  
**Input:** Zinc = 140 µg/dL, supplement misuse  
**Output:** Toxic level → risk of nausea and copper deficiency.  

---

## Case 19  
**Input:** Zinc = 55 µg/dL, dialysis patient  
**Output:** Deficiency common in chronic kidney disease.  

---

## Case 20  
**Input:** Zinc = 90 µg/dL, healthy athlete  
**Output:** Normal.  

---

## Case 21  
**Input:** Zinc = 62 µg/dL, woman with dermatitis  
**Output:** Deficiency → may cause skin issues.  

---

## Case 22  
**Input:** Zinc = 74 µg/dL, smoker with poor diet  
**Output:** Low-normal. At risk of deficiency.  

---

## Case 23  
**Input:** Zinc = 115 µg/dL, patient on multivitamins  
**Output:** Normal.  

---

## Case 24  
**Input:** Zinc = 52 µg/dL, patient with liver cirrhosis  
**Output:** Deficient → common in chronic liver disease.  

---

## Case 25  
**Input:** Zinc = 70 µg/dL, borderline case  
**Output:** Lower end of normal → dietary improvement needed.
