# Folate

**Normal Range:**  
2.7 – 17 ng/mL  


**Clinical Significance:**  
Folate (Vitamin B9) is essential for **DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation**.  
- Low folate can cause **megaloblastic anemia** and in pregnancy may lead to **neural tube defects**.  
- Folate deficiency often overlaps with **Vitamin B12 deficiency** but neurological symptoms are typically due to B12 deficiency.  

**Future Diseases:**  
- Megaloblastic anemia  
- Neural tube defects (in fetus during pregnancy)  
- Increased homocysteine → higher cardiovascular risk  
- Growth retardation in children  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain a folate-rich diet (leafy greens, beans, citrus, fortified grains)  
- Prenatal folic acid supplementation before and during pregnancy  
- Avoid excessive alcohol (impairs folate absorption)  
- Consider supplementation if on antifolate medications (e.g., methotrexate)  


**Case Studies:**

Case 1

Input: Folate = 12 ng/mL (female, 30 years old, healthy)
Output: Within normal range. Maintain balanced diet.

Case 2

Input: Folate = 3.0 ng/mL (male, 40 years old, fatigue, macrocytosis on CBC)
Output: Low folate likely causing megaloblastic anemia. Recommend folate supplementation and diet improvement.

Case 3

Input: Folate = 2.5 ng/mL (female, 25 years old, pregnant, first trimester)
Output: Deficient folate. High risk for neural tube defects in fetus. Immediate folic acid supplementation required.

Case 4

Input: Folate = 16 ng/mL (male, 22 years old, healthy athlete)
Output: Upper end of normal. No concerns.

Case 5

Input: Folate = 5.0 ng/mL (female, 60 years old, on methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis)
Output: Low folate due to antifolate drug. Folate supplementation indicated.

Case 6

Input: Folate = 2.8 ng/mL (male, 55 years old, chronic alcohol use)
Output: Deficient folate, likely alcohol-related. Reduce alcohol, begin supplementation.

Case 7

Input: Folate = 7.0 ng/mL (female, 32 years old, planning pregnancy)
Output: Adequate folate. Start folic acid supplements to prevent neural tube defects.

Case 8

Input: Folate = 2.9 ng/mL (male, 45 years old, chronic kidney disease)
Output: Deficient folate, common in renal disease. Supplementation required.

Case 9

Input: Folate = 10 ng/mL (child, 10 years old, balanced diet)
Output: Normal folate level. Maintain healthy diet.

Case 10

Input: Folate = 4.2 ng/mL (female, 70 years old, anemia and fatigue)
Output: Low folate causing megaloblastic anemia. Folate supplementation advised.

Case 11

Input: Folate = 15 ng/mL (male, 50 years old, healthy checkup)
Output: Normal folate. No issues.

Case 12

Input: Folate = 2.7 ng/mL (female, 28 years old, vegan diet without supplements)
Output: Borderline low folate. Dietary counseling and supplementation needed.

Case 13

Input: Folate = 3.5 ng/mL (male, 33 years old, seizures, on phenytoin)
Output: Low folate due to anticonvulsant therapy. Folate supplementation indicated.

Case 14

Input: Folate = 6.0 ng/mL (female, 50 years old, mild fatigue)
Output: Adequate folate. Symptoms may be due to another cause.

Case 15

Input: Folate = 8.0 ng/mL (male, 65 years old, diabetic)
Output: Normal folate. No concerns.

Case 16

Input: Folate = 2.2 ng/mL (female, 40 years old, with pernicious anemia history)
Output: Severe folate deficiency, though must also rule out Vitamin B12 deficiency. Supplementation required.

Case 17

Input: Folate = 9.5 ng/mL (male, 35 years old, vegetarian diet with fortified grains)
Output: Normal folate. No concerns.

Case 18

Input: Folate = 3.2 ng/mL (female, 20 years old, second trimester pregnancy)
Output: Folate deficiency. High risk for complications. Immediate supplementation required.

Case 19

Input: Folate = 11 ng/mL (male, 72 years old, hypertension)
Output: Normal folate. Continue balanced diet.

Case 20

Input: Folate = 2.9 ng/mL (female, 65 years old, on dialysis)
Output: Deficient folate, common in dialysis patients. Needs supplementation.

Case 21

Input: Folate = 14 ng/mL (child, 12 years old, healthy)
Output: Normal folate. No concerns.

Case 22

Input: Folate = 4.5 ng/mL (male, 55 years old, chronic inflammatory bowel disease)
Output: Low folate due to malabsorption. Supplementation required.

Case 23

Input: Folate = 2.6 ng/mL (female, 30 years old, recurrent miscarriages)
Output: Folate deficiency possibly contributing. Supplementation strongly recommended.

Case 24

Input: Folate = 6.8 ng/mL (male, 28 years old, healthy checkup)
Output: Within normal range. Maintain diet rich in folate.

Case 25

Input: Folate = 3.0 ng/mL (female, 75 years old, dementia symptoms)
Output: Low folate may worsen cognitive decline. Supplementation and evaluation for B12 deficiency needed.
