# Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)

**Normal Range:**  
11.5% – 14.5%  

**Clinical Significance:**  
RDW measures the variation in size of red blood cells (anisocytosis).  
- High RDW → suggests mixed population of small and large RBCs, often seen in nutritional anemias or bone marrow disorders.  
- Normal RDW → uniform RBC size, useful in classifying types of anemia.  

**Future Diseases:**  
- Iron-deficiency anemia  
- Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency  
- Hemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia)  
- Chronic liver disease  
- Bone marrow disorders  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Ensure balanced diet with iron, B12, and folate  
- Regular health checkups if chronically abnormal  
- Manage underlying chronic diseases  
- Follow physician’s advice for supplementation or treatment  

**Case Studies:**

Case 1 Input: RDW = 12.5% Output: Normal. RBCs are uniform in size. No concern.

Case 2 Input: RDW = 14.0% Output: Normal, upper end. Consistent with stable red cell population.

Case 3 Input: RDW = 15.5%, low MCV Output: Elevated RDW with low MCV suggests iron-deficiency anemia.

Case 4 Input: RDW = 16.2%, high MCV Output: Increased RDW with high MCV suggests vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.

Case 5 Input: RDW = 11.8% Output: Normal. No signs of anisocytosis.

Case 6 Input: RDW = 18.0%, normal MCV Output: High RDW with normal MCV may suggest early iron deficiency or mixed anemia.

Case 7 Input: RDW = 20%, patient with fatigue Output: Very high RDW. Strongly suggests nutritional anemia (iron or B12/folate).

Case 8 Input: RDW = 13.0% Output: Normal. No abnormal variation in RBC size.

Case 9 Input: RDW = 15.0%, child, pale Output: Elevated. Likely iron-deficiency anemia in pediatric patient.

Case 10 Input: RDW = 12.2% Output: Normal. Stable red cell size. 

Case 11 Input: RDW = 19%, alcoholic patient Output: High RDW, consistent with macrocytosis from alcohol-related folate deficiency.  

Case 12 Input: RDW = 17.2%, elderly male Output: Elevated, consider anemia of chronic disease or mixed deficiency.

Case 13 Input: RDW = 12.7%, stable labs Output: Normal. No anemia suggested.

Case 14 Input: RDW = 16.5%, pregnant female Output: Elevated. Could suggest iron deficiency common in pregnancy.

Case 15 Input: RDW = 13.2% Output: Normal. No abnormalities.

Case 16 Input: RDW = 21%, very high Output: Critically elevated. Suggests severe nutritional anemia or bone marrow disease.

Case 17 Input: RDW = 14.5% Output: Upper normal limit. Monitor if symptoms arise.

Case 18 Input: RDW = 11.6% Output: Normal, low end. No concern.

Case 19 Input: RDW = 15.7%, thalassemia trait suspected Output: Elevated, but thalassemia trait often has normal RDW with low MCV. Further testing needed.

Case 20 Input: RDW = 18.5%, chronic liver disease Output: Elevated. Consistent with liver-related RBC abnormalities.

Case 21 Input: RDW = 12.9% Output: Normal. Healthy range.

Case 22 Input: RDW = 17%, post-chemo patient Output: Elevated. Consistent with bone marrow recovery/abnormal production.

Case 23 Input: RDW = 14.8%, borderline Output: Slightly high. Monitor for early anemia development.

Case 24 Input: RDW = 22%, severe fatigue Output: Very high. Severe iron deficiency or megaloblastic anemia suspected.

Case 25 Input: RDW = 12.0% Output: Normal. No significant variation in RBC size.
