# Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol

**Normal Range (Optimal):**  
- Less than 100 mg/dL → Optimal  
- 100 – 129 mg/dL → Near optimal  
- 130 – 159 mg/dL → Borderline high  
- 160 – 189 mg/dL → High  
- 190 mg/dL and above → Very high  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
LDL is known as the "bad cholesterol." It contributes to **plaque buildup in arteries** (atherosclerosis), increasing risk of heart attack and stroke. Lower LDL levels are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk.

**Future Diseases / Risks:**  
- Coronary artery disease (CAD)  
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack)  
- Stroke  
- Peripheral artery disease (PAD)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Adopt a heart-healthy diet (low in saturated/trans fats)  
- Regular aerobic exercise  
- Weight management  
- Avoid smoking and limit alcohol  
- Take cholesterol-lowering medications (statins, etc.) if prescribed

### Case 2  
**Input:** LDL = 105 mg/dL, 28-year-old female  
**Output:** Near optimal. Encourage diet and exercise to prevent rise.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** LDL = 135 mg/dL, 40-year-old male, smoker  
**Output:** Borderline high. Increased cardiovascular risk due to smoking. Lifestyle change essential.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** LDL = 175 mg/dL, 52-year-old female with diabetes  
**Output:** High LDL. Strong indication for statin therapy.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** LDL = 195 mg/dL, 45-year-old male

### Case 6  
**Input:** LDL = 92 mg/dL, 60-year-old female, hypertensive  
**Output:** Within optimal range. Continue BP and cholesterol monitoring.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** LDL = 122 mg/dL, 25-year-old athlete  
**Output:** Slightly above optimal but acceptable with healthy lifestyle.  

### Case 8  
**Input:** LDL = 145 mg/dL, 55-year-old male, obese  
**Output:** Borderline high. Obesity increases risk; weight loss recommended.

**Output:** High LDL with strong family history. Aggressive risk reduction required.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** LDL = 200 mg/dL, 38-year-old male, no other risks  
**Output:** Very high LDL; likely genetic dyslipidemia. Start treatment urgently.  

### Case 11  
**Input:** LDL = 80 mg/dL, 70-year-old male with prior MI  
**Output:** Good LDL control post-MI. Continue medications and follow-up.  

### Case 12  
**Input:** LDL = 150 mg/dL, 50-year-old female, sedentary lifestyle  
**Output:** Borderline high; lifestyle modification and possible medication.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** LDL = 118 mg/dL, 19-year-old student  
**Output:** Near optimal. Preventive advice to maintain healthy diet/exercise.  

### Case 14  
**Input:** LDL = 160 mg/dL, 45-year-old female, smoker, diabetic  
**Output:** High risk profile. Statin therapy strongly indicated.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** LDL = 210 mg/dL, 35-year-old male with xanthomas  
**Output:** Suggestive of familial hypercholesterolemia. Needs urgent treatment.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** LDL = 95 mg/dL, 60-year-old female with hypertension  
**Output:** Optimal; maintain BP and cholesterol control.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** LDL = 132 mg/dL, 50-year-old male, borderline hypertension  
**Output:** Borderline high. Recommend lifestyle change, monitor closely.  

### Case 18  
**Input:** LDL = 182 mg/dL, 65-year-old female, CKD  
**Output:** High LDL plus kidney disease → high CV risk. Strong statin indication.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** LDL = 125 mg/dL, 42-year-old pregnant female  
**Output:** Mildly elevated; pregnancy can raise cholesterol. Monitor, avoid statins during pregnancy.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** LDL = 140 mg/dL, 15-year-old boy, obese  
**Output:** Childhood dyslipidemia. Needs dietary counseling and exercise.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** LDL = 172 mg/dL, 55-year-old male, alcohol use  
**Output:** High LDL plus alcohol-related risk. Advise abstinence and therapy.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** LDL = 200 mg/dL, 25-year-old female, family history of early MI  
**Output:** Severe familial hypercholesterolemia. Early treatment crucial.  

### Case 23  
**Input:** LDL = 115 mg/dL, 48-year-old male, normal BMI  
**Output:** Near optimal. Maintain healthy diet and activity.  

### Case 24  
**Input:** LDL = 165 mg/dL, 68-year-old female with osteoporosis  
**Output:** High LDL. Lifestyle changes and statins may reduce CV risk.  

### Case 25  
**Input:** LDL = 155 mg/dL, 30-year-old male, athlete, high saturated fat diet
