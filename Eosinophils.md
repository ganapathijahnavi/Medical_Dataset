# Eosinophils

**Normal Range:**  
1% – 4% of total WBC count (≈ 50 – 500 cells/µL)

**Clinical Significance:**  
Eosinophils are white blood cells involved in allergic reactions, asthma, and defense against parasitic infections. Abnormal counts may point to allergies, parasitic infestations, or hematologic disorders.

**Future Diseases (if abnormal):**  
- **Eosinophilia (high):** Asthma, hay fever, parasitic infections, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, autoimmune disease  
- **Eosinopenia (low):** Stress response, corticosteroid use, Cushing’s syndrome  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid allergens and manage asthma/allergy triggers  
- Practice good hygiene to prevent parasitic infections  
- Balanced diet and healthy lifestyle  
- Medical follow-up for persistent abnormalities
