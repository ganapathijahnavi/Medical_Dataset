# Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL)

**Normal Range:**  
5 – 40 mg/dL  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
VLDL is a type of lipoprotein made by the liver that carries **triglycerides** in the blood. Elevated VLDL is associated with **atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease**. VLDL is often estimated as **Triglycerides ÷ 5** (when triglycerides <400 mg/dL).  

---

**Future Diseases / Risks:**  
- Cardiovascular disease  
- Atherosclerosis  
- Pancreatitis (if triglycerides are very high)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Reduce refined carbs and sugar  
- Limit alcohol  
- Exercise regularly  
- Maintain healthy body weight  
- Take lipid-lowering medications if prescribed

## Case Interpretations (25 Cases)

### Case 1  
**Input:** VLDL = 12 mg/dL, 28-year-old male  
**Output:** Normal. Low cardiovascular risk.  

### Case 2  
**Input:** VLDL = 25 mg/dL, 35-year-old female  
**Output:** Normal, but approaching upper range. Maintain lifestyle.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** VLDL = 38 mg/dL, 45-year-old male, overweight  
**Output:** Borderline high. Increased risk; weight loss advised.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** VLDL = 50 mg/dL, 50-year-old female  
**Output:** Elevated. Hypertriglyceridemia; risk of atherosclerosis.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** VLDL = 70 mg/dL, 40-year-old male, diabetic  
**Output:** Very high; risk of pancreatitis. Urgent triglyceride control needed.  

### Case 6  
**Input:** VLDL = 10 mg/dL, 32-year-old athlete  
**Output:** Low-normal. No concern; indicates healthy lipid metabolism.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** VLDL = 28 mg/dL, 60-year-old female with hypertension  
**Output:** Slightly elevated; cardiovascular risk factor. Lifestyle changes needed.  

### Case 8  
**Input:** VLDL = 42 mg/dL, 38-year-old obese male  
**Output:** Above normal; linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome.  

### Case 9  
**Input:** VLDL = 15 mg/dL, 25-year-old healthy female  
**Output:** Normal. Maintain balanced lifestyle.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** VLDL = 55 mg/dL, 55-year-old male with fatty liver  
**Output:** Elevated due to liver dysfunction. Risk of CVD.

### Case 12  
**Input:** VLDL = 60 mg/dL, 45-year-old male with diabetes and CAD  
**Output:** Very high; major cardiovascular risk. Requires medication.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** VLDL = 14 mg/dL, 22-year-old student  
**Output:** Normal. Continue healthy diet.  

### Case 14  
**Input:** VLDL = 30 mg/dL, 65-year-old male, smoker  
**Output:** Slightly high; smoking increases risk further. Quit smoking, improve lifestyle.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** VLDL = 75 mg/dL, 50-year-old female, obese, diabetic  
**Output:** Severely elevated. Very high CVD and pancreatitis risk.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** VLDL = 18 mg/dL, 28-year-old male, vegetarian  
**Output:** Normal. Balanced lipid profile.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** VLDL = 48 mg/dL, 42-year-old female, sedentary  
**Output:** Elevated. Lifestyle modification needed (exercise, diet).  

### Case 18  
**Input:** VLDL = 35 mg/dL, 30-year-old male, heavy alcohol intake  
**Output:** High-normal; alcohol raises triglycerides. Recommend alcohol reduction.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** VLDL = 65 mg/dL, 58-year-old female with CKD  
**Output:** Elevated. Associated with CKD and increased CV risk.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** VLDL = 22 mg/dL, 40-year-old healthy male  
**Output:** Normal. No intervention needed.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** VLDL = 90 mg/dL, 45-year-old obese male, pancreatitis history  
**Output:** Critically high. Strong risk of recurrent pancreatitis. Urgent treatment needed.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** VLDL = 27 mg/dL, 34-year-old pregnant female  
**Output:** Slightly elevated; common in pregnancy. Monitor closely.  

### Case 23  
**Input:** VLDL = 50 mg/dL, 68-year-old male with metabolic syndrome  
**Output:** Elevated; part of metabolic syndrome cluster. Needs aggressive management.  

### Case 24  
**Input:** VLDL = 19 mg/dL, 26-year-old female, normal BMI  
**Output:** Normal. Maintain healthy diet and lifestyle.  

### Case 25  
**Input:** VLDL = 58 mg/dL, 48-year-old male, strong family history of CAD  
**Output:** Elevated. Genetic risk factors + high VLDL → high CV risk. Needs medical therapy.
