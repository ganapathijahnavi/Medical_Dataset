# Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL)

**Normal Range:**  
5 – 40 mg/dL  

**Clinical Significance:**  
VLDL is a type of lipoprotein made by the liver that carries triglycerides in the blood. Elevated VLDL is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. VLDL is often estimated as Triglycerides ÷ 5 (when triglycerides <400 mg/dL).  

**Future Diseases / Risks:**  
- Cardiovascular disease  
- Atherosclerosis  
- Pancreatitis (if triglycerides are very high)  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Reduce refined carbs and sugar  
- Limit alcohol  
- Exercise regularly  
- Maintain healthy body weight  
- Take lipid-lowering medications if prescribed  

**Case Studies:**

Case 1 Input: VLDL = 12 mg/dL, 28-year-old male Output: Normal. Low cardiovascular risk.

Case 2 Input: VLDL = 25 mg/dL, 35-year-old female Output: Normal, but approaching upper range. Maintain lifestyle.

Case 3 Input: VLDL = 38 mg/dL, 45-year-old male, overweight Output: Borderline high. Increased risk; weight loss advised.

Case 4 Input: VLDL = 50 mg/dL, 50-year-old female Output: Elevated. Hypertriglyceridemia; risk of atherosclerosis.

Case 5 Input: VLDL = 70 mg/dL, 40-year-old male, diabetic Output: Very high; risk of pancreatitis. Urgent triglyceride control needed.

Case 6 Input: VLDL = 10 mg/dL, 32-year-old athlete Output: Low-normal. No concern; indicates healthy lipid metabolism.

Case 7 Input: VLDL = 28 mg/dL, 60-year-old female with hypertension Output: Slightly elevated; cardiovascular risk factor. Lifestyle changes needed.

Case 8 Input: VLDL = 42 mg/dL, 38-year-old obese male Output: Above normal; linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome.

Case 9 Input: VLDL = 15 mg/dL, 25-year-old healthy female Output: Normal. Maintain balanced lifestyle.

Case 10 Input: VLDL = 55 mg/dL, 55-year-old male with fatty liver Output: Elevated due to liver dysfunction. Risk of CVD.

Case 11 Input: VLDL = 20 mg/dL, 70-year-old female, normal weight Output: Normal. Good lipid control.

Case 12 Input: VLDL = 60 mg/dL, 45-year-old male with diabetes and CAD Output: Very high; major cardiovascular risk. Requires medication.

Case 13 Input: VLDL = 14 mg/dL, 22-year-old student Output: Normal. Continue healthy diet.

Case 14 Input: VLDL = 30 mg/dL, 65-year-old male, smoker Output: Slightly high; smoking increases risk further. Quit smoking, improve lifestyle.

Case 15 Input: VLDL = 75 mg/dL, 50-year-old female, obese, diabetic Output: Severely elevated. Very high CVD and pancreatitis risk.

Case 16 Input: VLDL = 18 mg/dL, 28-year-old male, vegetarian Output: Normal. Balanced lipid profile.

Case 17 Input: VLDL = 48 mg/dL, 42-year-old female, sedentary Output: Elevated. Lifestyle modification needed (exercise, diet).

Case 18 Input: VLDL = 35 mg/dL, 30-year-old male, heavy alcohol intake Output: High-normal; alcohol raises triglycerides. Recommend alcohol reduction.

Case 19 Input: VLDL = 65 mg/dL, 58-year-old female with CKD Output: Elevated. Associated with CKD and increased CV risk.

Case 20 Input: VLDL = 22 mg/dL, 40-year-old healthy male Output: Normal. No intervention needed.

Case 21 Input: VLDL = 90 mg/dL, 45-year-old obese male, pancreatitis history Output: Critically high. Strong risk of recurrent pancreatitis. Urgent treatment needed.

Case 22 Input: VLDL = 27 mg/dL, 34-year-old pregnant female Output: Slightly elevated; common in pregnancy. Monitor closely.

Case 23 Input: VLDL = 50 mg/dL, 68-year-old male with metabolic syndrome Output: Elevated; part of metabolic syndrome cluster. Needs aggressive management.

Case 24 Input: VLDL = 19 mg/dL, 26-year-old female, normal BMI Output: Normal. Maintain healthy diet and lifestyle.

Case 25 Input: VLDL = 58 mg/dL, 48-year-old male, strong family history of CAD Output: Elevated. Genetic risk factors + high VLDL → high CV risk. Needs medical therapy.
