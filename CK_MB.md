# CK-MB (Creatine Kinase-MB)

**Normal Range:**  
0 – 5 ng/mL (may vary slightly by lab)  
CK-MB relative index: < 3% of total CK  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
CK-MB is an isoenzyme of creatine kinase found mainly in heart muscle. It rises within **3–6 hours after myocardial infarction (heart attack)**, peaks at 12–24 hours, and returns to normal within 48–72 hours. It helps differentiate **cardiac muscle damage** from **skeletal muscle injury**.

---

**Future Diseases / Conditions:**  
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack)  
- Myocarditis  
- Cardiac surgery trauma  
- Severe arrhythmias  
- Pulmonary embolism (rarely elevates)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain heart-healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, no smoking)  
- Monitor blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol  
- Immediate emergency care if chest pain + elevated CK-MB  
- Regular cardiac check-ups if at risk

## Case Interpretations (25 Cases)

### Case 1  
**Input:** CK-MB = 2 ng/mL, healthy adult  
**Output:** Normal. No evidence of cardiac damage.  

### Case 2  
**Input:** CK-MB = 4.5 ng/mL, chest pain ruled out as musculoskeletal  
**Output:** Normal. Likely non-cardiac cause of chest pain.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** CK-MB = 10 ng/mL, chest pain for 5 hours  
**Output:** Elevated. Possible early myocardial infarction. Urgent evaluation needed.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** CK-MB = 25 ng/mL, 12 hours post-chest pain onset  
**Output:** High. Consistent with acute myocardial infarction.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** CK-MB = 3 ng/mL, marathon runner post-race  
**Output:** Normal. Skeletal muscle CK may be elevated but not CK-MB.  

### Case 6  
**Input:** CK-MB = 8 ng/mL, heart failure patient  
**Output:** Mildly elevated. Can occur in myocardial stress. Monitor with troponin.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** CK-MB = 20 ng/mL, cardiac surgery recovery  
**Output:** Elevated due to surgical trauma, not infarction.  

### Case 8  
**Input:** CK-MB = 30 ng/mL, troponin I also elevated  
**Output:** Strong evidence of acute myocardial infarction.  

### Case 9  
**Input:** CK-MB = 18 ng/mL, myocarditis patient  
**Output:** Elevated due to heart muscle inflammation.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** CK-MB = 12 ng/mL, renal failure patient  
**Output:** Elevated. Kidney impairment may prolong enzyme clearance.  

### Case 11  
**Input:** CK-MB = 40 ng/mL, sudden cardiac arrest patient  
**Output:** Severe myocardial damage.  

### Case 12  
**Input:** CK-MB = 5 ng/mL, diabetic with chest discomfort  
**Output:** Borderline. Needs repeat testing + troponin.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** CK-MB = 2 ng/mL, young athlete, no symptoms  
**Output:** Normal. Healthy cardiac status.  

### Case 14  
**Input:** CK-MB = 15 ng/mL, patient with severe arrhythmia  
**Output:** Elevated. Can be due to cardiac stress/injury.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** CK-MB = 28 ng/mL, chest pain radiating to left arm  
**Output:** Elevated. Strong suspicion of myocardial infarction.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** CK-MB = 7 ng/mL, lung disease (pulmonary embolism)  
**Output:** Mild elevation possible due to strain on the heart.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** CK-MB = 35 ng/mL, after CPR resuscitation  
**Output:** Elevated due to cardiac injury from resuscitation efforts.  

### Case 18  
**Input:** CK-MB = 3 ng/mL, elderly woman with fatigue, no chest pain  
**Output:** Normal. Non-cardiac cause suspected.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** CK-MB = 60 ng/mL, massive MI  
**Output:** Very high. Extensive heart muscle damage.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** CK-MB = 5.5 ng/mL, repeat test in 3 hours shows 12 ng/mL  
**Output:** Rising trend indicates evolving myocardial infarction.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** CK-MB = 22 ng/mL, sepsis patient with cardiac involvement  
**Output:** Elevated. Secondary myocardial injury possible.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** CK-MB = 9 ng/mL, troponin normal  
**Output:** Possible non-MI cause (surgery, trauma, arrhythmia).  

### Case 23  
**Input:** CK-MB = 14 ng/mL, alcoholic cardiomyopathy  
**Output:** Elevated due to chronic cardiac muscle injury.  

### Case 24  
**Input:** CK-MB = 45 ng/mL, chest pain + ST-elevation on ECG  
**Output:** Strong evidence of acute STEMI. Emergency treatment required.  

### Case 25  
**Input:** CK-MB = 2.5 ng/mL, child with viral infection  
**Output:** Normal. CK-MB rarely elevated in pediatric viral illnesses.
