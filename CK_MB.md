# CK-MB (Creatine Kinase-MB)

**Normal Range:**  
0 – 5 ng/mL (may vary slightly by lab)  
CK-MB relative index: < 3% of total CK  

**Clinical Significance:**  
CK-MB is an isoenzyme of creatine kinase found mainly in heart muscle. It rises within **3–6 hours after myocardial infarction (heart attack)**, peaks at 12–24 hours, and returns to normal within 48–72 hours. It helps differentiate **cardiac muscle damage** from **skeletal muscle injury**.


**Future Diseases / Conditions:**  
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack)  
- Myocarditis  
- Cardiac surgery trauma  
- Severe arrhythmias  
- Pulmonary embolism (rarely elevates)  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain heart-healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, no smoking)  
- Monitor blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol  
- Immediate emergency care if chest pain + elevated CK-MB  
- Regular cardiac check-ups if at risk  


**Case Interpretations:** 

Case 1
Input: CK-MB = 2 ng/mL, healthy adult
Output: Normal. No evidence of cardiac damage.

Case 2
Input: CK-MB = 4.5 ng/mL, chest pain ruled out as musculoskeletal
Output: Normal. Likely non-cardiac cause of chest pain.

Case 3
Input: CK-MB = 10 ng/mL, chest pain for 5 hours
Output: Elevated. Possible early myocardial infarction. Urgent evaluation needed.

Case 4
Input: CK-MB = 25 ng/mL, 12 hours post-chest pain onset
Output: High. Consistent with acute myocardial infarction.

Case 5
Input: CK-MB = 3 ng/mL, marathon runner post-race
Output: Normal. Skeletal muscle CK may be elevated but not CK-MB.

Case 6
Input: CK-MB = 8 ng/mL, heart failure patient
Output: Mildly elevated. Can occur in myocardial stress. Monitor with troponin.

Case 7
Input: CK-MB = 20 ng/mL, cardiac surgery recovery
Output: Elevated due to surgical trauma, not infarction.

Case 8
Input: CK-MB = 30 ng/mL, troponin I also elevated
Output: Strong evidence of acute myocardial infarction.

Case 9
Input: CK-MB = 18 ng/mL, myocarditis patient
Output: Elevated due to heart muscle inflammation.

Case 10
Input: CK-MB = 12 ng/mL, renal failure patient
Output: Elevated. Kidney impairment may prolong enzyme clearance.

Case 11
Input: CK-MB = 40 ng/mL, sudden cardiac arrest patient
Output: Severe myocardial damage.

Case 12
Input: CK-MB = 5 ng/mL, diabetic with chest discomfort
Output: Borderline. Needs repeat testing + troponin.

Case 13
Input: CK-MB = 2 ng/mL, young athlete, no symptoms
Output: Normal. Healthy cardiac status.

Case 14
Input: CK-MB = 15 ng/mL, patient with severe arrhythmia
Output: Elevated. Can be due to cardiac stress/injury.

Case 15
Input: CK-MB = 28 ng/mL, chest pain radiating to left arm
Output: Elevated. Strong suspicion of myocardial infarction.

Case 16
Input: CK-MB = 7 ng/mL, lung disease (pulmonary embolism)
Output: Mild elevation possible due to strain on the heart.

Case 17
Input: CK-MB = 35 ng/mL, after CPR resuscitation
Output: Elevated due to cardiac injury from resuscitation efforts.

Case 18
Input: CK-MB = 3 ng/mL, elderly woman with fatigue, no chest pain
Output: Normal. Non-cardiac cause suspected.

Case 19
Input: CK-MB = 60 ng/mL, massive MI
Output: Very high. Extensive heart muscle damage.

Case 20
Input: CK-MB = 5.5 ng/mL, repeat test in 3 hours shows 12 ng/mL
Output: Rising trend indicates evolving myocardial infarction.

Case 21
Input: CK-MB = 22 ng/mL, sepsis patient with cardiac involvement
Output: Elevated. Secondary myocardial injury possible.

Case 22
Input: CK-MB = 9 ng/mL, troponin normal
Output: Possible non-MI cause (surgery, trauma, arrhythmia).

Case 23
Input: CK-MB = 14 ng/mL, alcoholic cardiomyopathy
Output: Elevated due to chronic cardiac muscle injury.

Case 24
Input: CK-MB = 45 ng/mL, chest pain + ST-elevation on ECG
Output: Strong evidence of acute STEMI. Emergency treatment required.

Case 25
Input: CK-MB = 2.5 ng/mL, child with viral infection
Output: Normal. CK-MB rarely elevated in pediatric viral illnesses.
