# Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)

**Normal Range:**  
10 – 65 pg/mL *(may vary slightly by lab)*  

**Clinical Significance:**  
PTH is secreted by the parathyroid glands and regulates **calcium and phosphate metabolism**.  
- High PTH → usually indicates **hyperparathyroidism** or secondary elevation due to low calcium/vitamin D.  
- Low PTH → often linked to **hypoparathyroidism** or suppression by high calcium.  

**Future Diseases / Risks:**  
- **Hyperparathyroidism** (primary, secondary, tertiary)  
- Osteoporosis & bone fragility  
- Chronic kidney disease with secondary hyperparathyroidism  
- Hypoparathyroidism → hypocalcemia, neuromuscular symptoms  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain balanced calcium and vitamin D intake  
- Regular bone density monitoring if at risk  
- Kidney health management  
- Medical treatment (calcimimetics, vitamin D, surgery) when indicated  

**Case Studies:**

Case 1 Input: PTH = 45 pg/mL, Calcium = 9.2 mg/dL Output: Normal. Balanced calcium regulation.

Case 2 Input: PTH = 120 pg/mL, Calcium = 11.2 mg/dL Output: Elevated. Primary hyperparathyroidism likely.

Case 3 Input: PTH = 15 pg/mL, Calcium = 12.0 mg/dL Output: Low. Hypercalcemia of malignancy (PTH-independent).

Case 4 Input: PTH = 150 pg/mL, Calcium = 8.0 mg/dL, CKD patient Output: Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to kidney failure.

Case 5 Input: PTH = 5 pg/mL, Calcium = 7.0 mg/dL Output: Low. Hypoparathyroidism → hypocalcemia.

Case 6 Input: PTH = 200 pg/mL, Calcium = 8.5 mg/dL, Vitamin D deficient Output: Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency.

Case 7 Input: PTH = 70 pg/mL, Calcium = 10.5 mg/dL Output: Borderline elevation; possible early primary hyperparathyroidism.

Case 8 Input: PTH = 300 pg/mL, Calcium = 12.5 mg/dL, kidney transplant patient Output: Tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Case 9 Input: PTH = 12 pg/mL, Calcium = 9.5 mg/dL Output: Low-normal. Likely physiological.

Case 10 Input: PTH = 250 pg/mL, Calcium = 7.8 mg/dL Output: Elevated with hypocalcemia → secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Case 11 Input: PTH = 100 pg/mL, Calcium = 11.5 mg/dL, bone pain Output: Primary hyperparathyroidism (symptomatic).

Case 12 Input: PTH = 30 pg/mL, Calcium = 13.0 mg/dL, lung cancer Output: Suppressed. Likely PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia.

Case 13 Input: PTH = 400 pg/mL, Calcium = 7.5 mg/dL, CKD stage 5 Output: Severe secondary hyperparathyroidism from renal failure.

Case 14 Input: PTH = 20 pg/mL, Calcium = 6.5 mg/dL, muscle cramps Output: Hypoparathyroidism with symptomatic hypocalcemia.

Case 15 Input: PTH = 65 pg/mL, Calcium = 9.0 mg/dL Output: Upper-normal; may be compensatory in vitamin D insufficiency.

Case 16 Input: PTH = 90 pg/mL, Calcium = 8.6 mg/dL, phosphate high Output: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (CKD-related).

Case 17 Input: PTH = 140 pg/mL, Calcium = 9.3 mg/dL, on dialysis Output: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (renal disease).

Case 18 Input: PTH = 110 pg/mL, Calcium = 10.2 mg/dL, osteoporosis patient Output: Primary hyperparathyroidism contributing to bone loss.

Case 19 Input: PTH = 10 pg/mL, Calcium = 7.2 mg/dL, post-thyroid surgery Output: Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

Case 20 Input: PTH = 15 pg/mL, Calcium = 10.8 mg/dL Output: Low PTH with hypercalcemia; not parathyroid mediated.

Case 21 Input: PTH = 180 pg/mL, Calcium = 11.8 mg/dL Output: Strongly suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Case 22 Input: PTH = 90 pg/mL, Calcium = 9.0 mg/dL, vitamin D = low Output: Secondary hyperparathyroidism due to vitamin D deficiency.

Case 23 Input: PTH = 35 pg/mL, Calcium = 12.0 mg/dL, metastatic breast cancer Output: Suppressed PTH; hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Case 24 Input: PTH = 160 pg/mL, Calcium = 9.5 mg/dL, phosphate low Output: Primary hyperparathyroidism (phosphate wasting).

Case 25 Input: PTH = 220 pg/mL, Calcium = 8.2 mg/dL, CKD with bone pain Output: Renal osteodystrophy with secondary hyperparathyroidism.
