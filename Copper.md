# Copper (Cu)

**Normal Range:**  
- Serum Copper: 70 – 140 µg/dL  


**Clinical Significance:**  
Copper is an essential trace element required for:  
- Iron metabolism (works with ceruloplasmin)  
- Nervous system health  
- Immune function  
- Connective tissue formation  

**Abnormal levels:**  
- Low copper → anemia, neuropathy, weak immunity.  
- High copper → Wilson’s disease, liver dysfunction, copper toxicity.  


**Future Diseases:**  
- Wilson’s disease (copper overload in tissues)  
- Menkes disease (genetic copper deficiency disorder)  
- Anemia and neutropenia (low copper)  
- Liver disease  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Include copper-rich foods: shellfish, nuts, seeds, whole grains, beans, liver.  
- Avoid excessive supplementation.  
- Genetic screening for inherited disorders (Wilson’s, Menkes).  
- Monitor copper levels in chronic liver or kidney disease.  

**Case Interpretations:**

Case 1 – 60 µg/dL (adult, anemia/fatigue) → Low copper, supplementation/dietary increase.

Case 2 – 75 µg/dL (healthy adult) → Low-normal, encourage copper-rich diet.

Case 3 – 130 µg/dL (pregnant woman) → Upper-normal, normal in pregnancy.

Case 4 – 200 µg/dL (liver disease) → Elevated, possible Wilson’s disease, further testing.

Case 5 – 50 µg/dL (child, poor growth) → Deficiency affecting growth/bone.

Case 6 – 80 µg/dL (adult vegetarian) → Normal, monitor diet.

Case 7 – 40 µg/dL (infant, seizures, kinky hair) → Severe deficiency, suggestive of Menkes disease.

Case 8 – 145 µg/dL (adult on supplements) → Slightly high, risk of toxicity.

Case 9 – 70 µg/dL (elderly, neuropathy) → Low-normal, may contribute to neuropathy.

Case 10 – 95 µg/dL (healthy adult) → Normal, maintain diet.

Case 11 – 30 µg/dL (child, frequent infections) → Severe deficiency, immune dysfunction.

Case 12 – 160 µg/dL (patient with jaundice) → Elevated, possible liver disease.

Case 13 – 68 µg/dL (woman, brittle hair/pale skin) → Low copper, contributing to symptoms.

Case 14 – 110 µg/dL (athlete) → Normal.

Case 15 – 85 µg/dL (diabetic patient) → Normal, monitor wound healing.

Case 16 – 150 µg/dL (fatigue/abdominal pain) → Elevated, consider supplement overuse or liver issue.

Case 17 – 55 µg/dL (dialysis patient) → Deficiency, common in CKD.

Case 18 – 125 µg/dL (asymptomatic adult) → Normal.

Case 19 – 100 µg/dL (pregnant woman) → Normal, pregnancy-related increase.

Case 20 – 72 µg/dL (office worker, mild fatigue) → Low-normal, encourage copper-rich foods.

Case 21 – 190 µg/dL (adolescent, tremors) → Elevated, possible Wilson’s disease, requires testing.

Case 22 – 65 µg/dL (elderly, anemia unresponsive to iron) → Copper deficiency anemia suspected.
Case 23 – 88 µg/dL (teenager, vegan diet) → Normal, monitor intake.
Case 24 – 48 µg/dL (infant, developmental delay) → Severe deficiency, affects brain development.
Case 25 – 105 µg/dL (healthy young adult) → Normal.
