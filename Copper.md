# Copper (Cu)

**Normal Range:**  
- Serum Copper: 70 – 140 µg/dL  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Copper is an essential trace element required for:  
- Iron metabolism (works with ceruloplasmin)  
- Nervous system health  
- Immune function  
- Connective tissue formation  

**Abnormal levels:**  
- Low copper → anemia, neuropathy, weak immunity.  
- High copper → Wilson’s disease, liver dysfunction, copper toxicity.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Wilson’s disease (copper overload in tissues)  
- Menkes disease (genetic copper deficiency disorder)  
- Anemia and neutropenia (low copper)  
- Liver disease  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Include copper-rich foods: shellfish, nuts, seeds, whole grains, beans, liver.  
- Avoid excessive supplementation.  
- Genetic screening for inherited disorders (Wilson’s, Menkes).  
- Monitor copper levels in chronic liver or kidney disease.

# Case Interpretations

## Case 1  
**Input:** Copper = 60 µg/dL, adult with anemia and fatigue  
**Output:** Low copper contributing to anemia. Increase dietary copper or supplements under medical advice.  

---

## Case 2  
**Input:** Copper = 75 µg/dL, healthy adult  
**Output:** Low-normal. Encourage balanced diet with copper-rich foods.  

---

## Case 3  
**Input:** Copper = 130 µg/dL, pregnant woman  
**Output:** Upper-normal. Normal in pregnancy due to increased ceruloplasmin.  

---

## Case 4  
**Input:** Copper = 200 µg/dL, patient with liver disease  
**Output:** Elevated → possible Wilson’s disease or chronic liver condition. Needs further testing.  

---

## Case 5  
**Input:** Copper = 50 µg/dL, child with poor growth  
**Output:** Deficiency affecting growth and bone health.  

---

## Case 6  
**Input:** Copper = 80 µg/dL, adult vegetarian  
**Output:** Normal but monitor diet. Plant-based diets may have lower copper absorption.  

---

## Case 7  
**Input:** Copper = 40 µg/dL, infant with seizures and kinky hair  
**Output:** Suggestive of Menkes disease (genetic copper transport disorder).  

---

## Case 8  
**Input:** Copper = 145 µg/dL, adult on copper supplements  
**Output:** Slightly high. Risk of toxicity with chronic use.  

---

## Case 9  
**Input:** Copper = 70 µg/dL, elderly with neuropathy  
**Output:** Low-normal. Copper deficiency can contribute to neuropathy.  

---

## Case 10  
**Input:** Copper = 95 µg/dL, healthy adult  
**Output:** Normal. Maintain balanced diet.  

---

## Case 11  
**Input:** Copper = 30 µg/dL, child with frequent infections  
**Output:** Severe deficiency causing immune dysfunction.  

---

## Case 12  
**Input:** Copper = 160 µg/dL, patient with jaundice  
**Output:** Elevated copper due to possible liver disease.  

---

## Case 13  
**Input:** Copper = 68 µg/dL, woman with brittle hair and pale skin  
**Output:** Low copper contributing to skin and hair issues.  

---

## Case 14  
**Input:** Copper = 110 µg/dL, athlete  
**Output:** Normal. Adequate intake through diet.  

---

## Case 15  
**Input:** Copper = 85 µg/dL, diabetic patient  
**Output:** Normal but slightly low. Monitor for wound healing issues.  

---

## Case 16  
**Input:** Copper = 150 µg/dL, adult with fatigue and abdominal pain  
**Output:** Elevated copper. Possible supplement overuse or liver dysfunction.  

---

## Case 17  
**Input:** Copper = 55 µg/dL, dialysis patient  
**Output:** Deficiency → common in chronic kidney disease.  

---

## Case 18  
**Input:** Copper = 125 µg/dL, adult with no symptoms  
**Output:** Normal.  

---

## Case 19  
**Input:** Copper = 100 µg/dL, pregnant woman  
**Output:** Normal. Pregnancy increases copper-binding proteins.  

---

## Case 20  
**Input:** Copper = 72 µg/dL, office worker with mild fatigue  
**Output:** Low-normal. Encourage copper-rich foods.  

---

## Case 21  
**Input:** Copper = 190 µg/dL, adolescent with tremors  
**Output:** Elevated copper. Possible Wilson’s disease → needs ceruloplasmin and genetic testing.  

---

## Case 22  
**Input:** Copper = 65 µg/dL, elderly with anemia unresponsive to iron  
**Output:** Copper deficiency anemia suspected.  

---

## Case 23  
**Input:** Copper = 88 µg/dL, teenager on vegan diet  
**Output:** Normal but monitor intake.  

---

## Case 24  
**Input:** Copper = 48 µg/dL, infant with developmental delay  
**Output:** Severe deficiency → may affect brain development.  

---

## Case 25  
**Input:** Copper = 105 µg/dL, healthy young adult  
**Output:** Normal. Maintain diet balance.
