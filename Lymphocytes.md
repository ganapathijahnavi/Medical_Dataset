# Lymphocytes

**Normal Range:**  
20% – 40% of total WBC count (≈ 1,000 – 4,800 cells/µL)

**Clinical Significance:**  
Lymphocytes (T-cells, B-cells, NK cells) are essential for adaptive immunity. They defend against viral infections, produce antibodies, and regulate immune responses. Abnormal counts may indicate viral illness, immune suppression, or lymphoproliferative disorders.

**Future Diseases (if abnormal):**  
- **Lymphocytosis (high):** Viral infections, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), tuberculosis  
- **Lymphocytopenia (low):** HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, corticosteroid therapy, autoimmune diseases  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain strong immunity with balanced diet (vitamins A, C, D, zinc)  
- Adequate sleep and stress management  
- Vaccinations to prevent infections  
- Medical follow-up if persistent abnormality
