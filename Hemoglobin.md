# Hemoglobin (Hgb)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Men (adult):** 13.8 – 17.2 g/dL  
- **Women (adult):** 12.1 – 15.1 g/dL  
- **Pregnant women:** > 11.0 g/dL (mild anemia common in 2nd/3rd trimester)  
- **Children (6–12 years):** 11.5 – 15.5 g/dL  
- **Infants (6 months–1 year):** 11.0 – 13.5 g/dL  
- **Newborns (0–1 month):** 13.5 – 20.0 g/dL  

*(Ranges may vary slightly depending on laboratory and methodology)*

**Clinical Significance:**  
Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells (RBCs). It reflects the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues.  
- **Low levels (anemia):** May result from iron deficiency, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, blood loss, chronic diseases, or bone marrow disorders.  
- **High levels (polycythemia):** Can occur with chronic hypoxia (COPD, smoking, high altitude), dehydration, or bone marrow disorders (polycythemia vera).

**Future Diseases & Risks of Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Low Hemoglobin (Anemia-related risks):**  
  - Iron deficiency anemia  
  - Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anemia  
  - Chronic kidney disease  
  - Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, cancers  
  - Sickle cell anemia, thalassemia  
- **High Hemoglobin (Polycythemia-related risks):**  
  - Polycythemia vera  
  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  
  - Pulmonary hypertension  
  - Obstructive sleep apnea  
  - Dehydration-related false elevation

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- **For Low Hemoglobin:**  
  - Eat iron-rich foods (red meat, leafy greens, beans, fortified cereals)  
  - Increase vitamin B12 & folate intake (dairy, eggs, fish, leafy vegetables)  
  - Avoid excessive alcohol consumption  
  - Regular medical monitoring if chronic illness is present  
- **For High Hemoglobin:**  
  - Stay well hydrated  
  - Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol  
  - Limit exposure to high altitudes if possible  
  - Engage in regular moderate exercise  
  - Seek medical advice for persistent high values
