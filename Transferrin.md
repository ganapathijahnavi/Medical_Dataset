# TIBC / Transferrin

**Normal Range:**  
- TIBC: 240 – 450 µg/dL  
- Transferrin: 200 – 360 mg/dL  

**Clinical Significance:**  
TIBC (Total Iron-Binding Capacity) measures blood’s ability to bind iron with transferrin.  
High TIBC indicates **iron deficiency**, while low TIBC suggests **chronic disease or iron overload**.  

**Future Diseases:**  
- Iron-deficiency anemia (↑ TIBC)  
- Anemia of chronic disease (↓ TIBC)  
- Hemochromatosis (↓ TIBC)  

**Case Studies:**

Case 1 Input: TIBC = 180 µg/dL Output: Very low, suggests anemia of chronic disease or liver disease.

Case 2 Input: TIBC = 200 µg/dL Output: Low, possible chronic illness or iron overload.

Case 3 Input: TIBC = 220 µg/dL Output: Low, may indicate malnutrition or inflammation.

Case 4 Input: TIBC = 230 µg/dL Output: Borderline low, needs correlation with serum iron/ferritin.

Case 5 Input: TIBC = 240 µg/dL Output: Lower limit of normal.

Case 6 Input: TIBC = 250 µg/dL Output: Low-normal, possible chronic disease.

Case 7 Input: TIBC = 260 µg/dL Output: Normal.

Case 8 Input: TIBC = 270 µg/dL Output: Normal.

Case 9 Input: TIBC = 280 µg/dL Output: Normal.

Case 10 Input: TIBC = 300 µg/dL Output: Normal.

Case 11 Input: TIBC = 320 µg/dL Output: Normal.

Case 12 Input: TIBC = 340 µg/dL Output: Normal.

Case 13 Input: TIBC = 360 µg/dL Output: Normal-high, may suggest early iron deficiency.

Case 14 Input: TIBC = 380 µg/dL Output: Elevated, possible iron deficiency anemia.

Case 15 Input: TIBC = 400 µg/dL Output: Elevated, typical of iron deficiency anemia.

Case 16 Input: TIBC = 410 µg/dL Output: High, supports iron deficiency.

Case 17 Input: TIBC = 420 µg/dL Output: High, consistent with iron deficiency anemia.

Case 18 Input: TIBC = 430 µg/dL Output: High, needs iron studies confirmation.

Case 19 Input: TIBC = 440 µg/dL Output: High, typical iron deficiency picture.

Case 20 Input: TIBC = 450 µg/dL Output: Upper normal limit, borderline high.

Case 21 Input: TIBC = 460 µg/dL Output: Mildly above range, suggests iron deficiency.

Case 22 Input: TIBC = 470 µg/dL Output: Elevated, needs ferritin check.

Case 23 Input: TIBC = 480 µg/dL Output: Significantly high, consistent with deficiency.

Case 24 Input: TIBC = 500 µg/dL Output: Markedly high, strong suspicion of iron deficiency anemia.
  
Case 25 Input: TIBC = 520 µg/dL Output: Very high, severe iron deficiency anemia.
