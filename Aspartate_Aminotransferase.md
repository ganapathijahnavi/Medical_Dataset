# Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- Adults: **10 – 40 IU/L**  
- Children: Slightly higher in some labs (up to 60 IU/L)  
- Newborns: May be higher due to immature liver  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
AST is an enzyme found in the **liver, heart, muscles, kidneys, and brain**.  
- Elevated AST indicates **cell/tissue damage** in these organs.  
- It is often measured with **ALT** to assess **liver health**.  
- **AST:ALT ratio** helps distinguish different liver conditions:  
  - **>2:1** → Alcoholic liver disease  
  - **<1** → Viral hepatitis, fatty liver  

---

**Future Diseases Associated with Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Liver disease** (hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver)  
- **Heart attack (myocardial infarction)**  
- **Muscle injury or disease** (rhabdomyolysis, muscular dystrophy)  
- **Kidney disease**  
- **Alcohol-related damage**  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid **alcohol and hepatotoxic drugs** (acetaminophen overdose risk).  
- Maintain a **healthy weight** to prevent fatty liver disease.  
- Regular **exercise** but avoid excessive muscle strain before testing.  
- Routine **liver function monitoring** if at risk.  
- Medical follow-up for persistent elevation.
