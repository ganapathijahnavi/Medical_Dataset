# International Normalized Ratio (INR)

**Normal Range:**  
- 0.8 to 1.2 (for individuals not on anticoagulant therapy)  
- 2.0 to 3.0 (typical therapeutic range for patients on warfarin for atrial fibrillation, DVT, PE)  
- 2.5 to 3.5 (mechanical heart valves or higher risk conditions)  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
INR (International Normalized Ratio) is a standardized measure of blood clotting time.  
- **Low INR** → increased risk of clot formation  
- **High INR** → increased risk of bleeding  

It is crucial in monitoring patients on anticoagulant medications like **warfarin**.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  
- Pulmonary embolism (PE)  
- Stroke (if too low on anticoagulants)  
- Hemorrhage (if too high on anticoagulants)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- **Regular INR monitoring** if on anticoagulants  
- **Maintain consistent vitamin K intake** (sudden changes in green leafy vegetables can alter INR)  
- **Avoid alcohol binges**  
- **Take medications exactly as prescribed**  
- **Report any bleeding or clotting symptoms** immediately

# Case Studies 

### Case 1  
**Input:** INR = 1.0 (healthy adult, not on anticoagulants)  
**Output:** Normal clotting function. No concerns.  

---

### Case 2  
**Input:** INR = 1.5 (not on anticoagulants, male, 40 years)  
**Output:** Mildly prolonged clotting. Could suggest liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or medication effect.  

---

### Case 3  
**Input:** INR = 2.5 (female, 55 years, on warfarin for atrial fibrillation)  
**Output:** Within therapeutic range. Continue regular monitoring.  

---

### Case 4  
**Input:** INR = 4.2 (male, 60 years, on warfarin)  
**Output:** Elevated INR. Increased risk of bleeding. Dose adjustment required.  

---

### Case 5  
**Input:** INR = 0.9 (female, 35 years, healthy)  
**Output:** Normal. No issues.  

---

### Case 6  
**Input:** INR = 1.8 (male, 70 years, on warfarin for DVT)  
**Output:** Below therapeutic range. Increased risk of clot formation. Dose adjustment needed.  

---

### Case 7  
**Input:** INR = 3.0 (female, 45 years, on mechanical heart valve, target 2.5–3.5)  
**Output:** At therapeutic target. Continue current regimen.  

---

### Case 8  
**Input:** INR = 5.5 (male, 65 years, on anticoagulants, with nosebleeds)  
**Output:** Critically high INR with bleeding symptoms. Urgent medical attention needed.  

---

### Case 9  
**Input:** INR = 1.2 (female, 25 years, not on anticoagulants, pregnant)  
**Output:** Normal. Pregnancy usually doesn’t affect INR.  

---

### Case 10  
**Input:** INR = 2.0 (male, 55 years, on warfarin for pulmonary embolism)  
**Output:** At lower end of therapeutic range. Monitor closely.  

---

### Case 11  
**Input:** INR = 1.4 (female, 30 years, liver disease)  
**Output:** Mildly elevated INR likely due to impaired clotting factor synthesis.  

---

### Case 12  
**Input:** INR = 7.0 (male, 70 years, on warfarin, presenting with GI bleeding)  
**Output:** Critically high INR, life-threatening bleeding risk. Immediate hospitalization needed.  

---

### Case 13  
**Input:** INR = 0.8 (female, 40 years, healthy)  
**Output:** Slightly low, but still considered normal.  

---

### Case 14  
**Input:** INR = 2.8 (male, 50 years, post-DVT, on anticoagulants)  
**Output:** Well within therapeutic range. Continue treatment.  

---

### Case 15  
**Input:** INR = 3.8 (female, 60 years, on warfarin, bruising easily)  
**Output:** High INR. Increased bleeding risk. Dose likely needs reduction.  

---

### Case 16  
**Input:** INR = 1.0 (infant, 6 months, healthy)  
**Output:** Normal for infants not on therapy.  

---

### Case 17  
**Input:** INR = 2.2 (male, 35 years, on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation)  
**Output:** Within therapeutic range. Stable.  

---

### Case 18  
**Input:** INR = 1.6 (female, 28 years, not on anticoagulants, history of poor diet)  
**Output:** Elevated. Could suggest vitamin K deficiency.  

---

### Case 19  
**Input:** INR = 3.2 (male, 45 years, on mechanical valve replacement)  
**Output:** Appropriate therapeutic range.  

---

### Case 20  
**Input:** INR = 1.3 (elderly female, 80 years, no anticoagulants, on antibiotics)  
**Output:** Slightly elevated. Certain antibiotics can affect INR.  

---

### Case 21  
**Input:** INR = 6.0 (male, 72 years, on warfarin, no bleeding yet)  
**Output:** Very high INR. High bleeding risk. Urgent dose adjustment and monitoring.  

---

### Case 22  
**Input:** INR = 2.9 (female, 50 years, on warfarin for DVT)  
**Output:** Therapeutic INR. Stable.  

---

### Case 23  
**Input:** INR = 4.8 (male, 65 years, on warfarin, with gum bleeding)  
**Output:** High INR. Increased bleeding risk. Dose adjustment required.  

---
