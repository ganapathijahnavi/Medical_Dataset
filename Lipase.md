# Lipase

**Normal Range:**  
10 – 140 U/L (may vary by lab)


**Clinical Significance:**  
Lipase is a digestive enzyme secreted by the pancreas that breaks down dietary fats.  
- **Elevated lipase** is a sensitive marker of **pancreatitis** (acute or chronic).  
- Mild elevations can also be seen in gallbladder disease, kidney disease, intestinal obstruction, or certain cancers.  
- Persistently high values require medical investigation.  


**Future Diseases:**  
- Acute pancreatitis  
- Chronic pancreatitis  
- Gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis)  
- Pancreatic cancer  
- Kidney failure (reduced clearance of lipase)  
- Intestinal obstruction  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- **Avoid alcohol** to reduce pancreatic stress  
- **Limit fatty foods** to prevent flare-ups  
- **Stay hydrated**  
- **Maintain healthy body weight**  
- **Seek urgent medical attention** for abdominal pain with high lipase  

**Case Studies:** 
Case 1

Input: Lipase = 35 U/L (male, 30 years, healthy)
Output: Normal lipase. No concerns.

Case 2

Input: Lipase = 180 U/L (female, 45 years, mild abdominal pain)
Output: Slightly elevated. Could indicate early pancreatic irritation or gallbladder issue. Monitor.

Case 3

Input: Lipase = 600 U/L (male, 50 years, severe abdominal pain, nausea)
Output: Markedly elevated. Suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Requires urgent hospitalization.

Case 4

Input: Lipase = 20 U/L (female, 25 years, healthy)
Output: Normal enzyme level. No concerns.

Case 5

Input: Lipase = 250 U/L (male, 70 years, chronic alcohol use)
Output: Elevated, likely due to chronic pancreatitis. Alcohol cessation and medical management required.

Case 6

Input: Lipase = 800 U/L (female, 40 years, gallstone history)
Output: Very high, likely gallstone-induced pancreatitis. Emergency care needed.

Case 7

Input: Lipase = 50 U/L (male, 60 years, diabetic, routine labs)
Output: Normal lipase. No issues.

Case 8

Input: Lipase = 320 U/L (female, 28 years, pregnant, abdominal pain)
Output: Elevated lipase in pregnancy. Possible pancreatitis or gallbladder disease. Needs urgent evaluation.

Case 9

Input: Lipase = 140 U/L (male, 45 years, borderline value)
Output: At the upper limit of normal. Monitor for symptoms.

Case 10

Input: Lipase = 900 U/L (female, 50 years, pancreatic cancer)
Output: Extremely elevated. Common in pancreatic malignancy. Oncology evaluation required.

Case 11

Input: Lipase = 110 U/L (male, 35 years, kidney disease)
Output: Normal but slightly high due to reduced clearance in kidney disease.

Case 12

Input: Lipase = 70 U/L (female, 20 years, healthy)
Output: Normal. No issues.

Case 13

Input: Lipase = 400 U/L (male, 65 years, severe epigastric pain)
Output: High lipase, consistent with acute pancreatitis. Hospitalization required.

Case 14

Input: Lipase = 130 U/L (female, 55 years, gallbladder stones)
Output: Upper normal range, possible early biliary involvement.

Case 15

Input: Lipase = 15 U/L (male, 45 years, routine labs)
Output: Low-normal lipase, not clinically significant.

Case 16

Input: Lipase = 500 U/L (female, 38 years, post-ERCP procedure)
Output: Elevated, common after pancreatic procedures. Requires monitoring.

Case 17

Input: Lipase = 175 U/L (male, 29 years, heavy alcohol binge)
Output: Slight elevation, possible alcohol-induced pancreatic irritation.

Case 18

Input: Lipase = 1,200 U/L (female, 70 years, severe abdominal pain, shock)
Output: Critically high lipase, severe acute pancreatitis with possible complications. Emergency.

Case 19

Input: Lipase = 80 U/L (male, 55 years, high cholesterol, obese)
Output: Normal lipase. No direct pancreatic concern.

Case 20

Input: Lipase = 260 U/L (female, 60 years, renal failure)
Output: Elevated due to reduced clearance in kidney disease.

Case 21

Input: Lipase = 600 U/L (male, 35 years, trauma to abdomen)
Output: High, consistent with pancreatic injury post-trauma.

Case 22

Input: Lipase = 145 U/L (female, 32 years, no symptoms)
Output: Borderline elevated. Monitor and correlate clinically.

Case 23

Input: Lipase = 410 U/L (male, 48 years, history of gallstones)
Output: Elevated, likely gallstone pancreatitis. Immediate care needed.

Case 24

Input: Lipase = 95 U/L (female, 27 years, healthy, on routine check)
Output: Normal. No issues.

Case 25

Input: Lipase = 720 U/L (male, 60 years, known pancreatic cancer)
Output: High lipase. Supports pancreatic tissue damage. Oncology follow-up essential.
