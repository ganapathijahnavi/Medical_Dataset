# Potassium

**Normal Range:**  
3.5 – 5.1 mmol/L  

**Clinical Significance:**  
Potassium is crucial for **nerve conduction, muscle contraction, and heart rhythm**.  
- **Low potassium (hypokalemia):** Causes weakness, cramps, and arrhythmias.  
- **High potassium (hyperkalemia):** Can be life-threatening with severe arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.  

**Future Diseases:**  
- Hypokalemia (caused by diuretics, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition)  
- Hyperkalemia (renal failure, medications like ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics)  
- Cardiac arrhythmias  
- Neuromuscular disorders  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain balanced potassium intake (fruits, vegetables, whole foods)  
- Monitor medications that affect potassium levels  
- Avoid excessive potassium supplements unless prescribed  
- Seek immediate medical care for muscle weakness, palpitations, or severe symptoms  

**Case Studies:**

Case 1 Input: Potassium = 3.0 mmol/L (female, 35 years old) Output: Mild hypokalemia. Possible diuretic effect or dietary deficiency. Increase dietary potassium and review medications.

Case 2 Input: Potassium = 4.0 mmol/L (male, 28 years old) Output: Normal. No intervention needed. Maintain healthy diet.

Case 3 Input: Potassium = 5.8 mmol/L (male, 55 years old, with CKD) Output: Hyperkalemia due to chronic kidney disease. Risk of arrhythmias. Requires urgent medical management.

Case 4 Input: Potassium = 3.4 mmol/L (female, 42 years old, on diuretics) Output: Borderline hypokalemia. Likely drug-induced. May need potassium supplementation.

Case 5 Input: Potassium = 4.8 mmol/L (male, 65 years old, hypertensive) Output: Normal-high. Monitor if taking ACE inhibitors.

Case 6 Input: Potassium = 2.9 mmol/L (child, 10 years old, male) Output: Hypokalemia. Could cause muscle weakness or cramps. Needs evaluation for GI loss or diet.

Case 7 Input: Potassium = 6.5 mmol/L (female, 30 years old, diabetic) Output: Severe hyperkalemia, potentially life-threatening. Emergency care required.

Case 8 Input: Potassium = 3.7 mmol/L (infant, 1 year old) Output: Normal range for infant. No issues.

Case 9 Input: Potassium = 5.3 mmol/L (male, 45 years old, on spironolactone) Output: Mild hyperkalemia, likely drug-related. Adjust medication dose.

Case 10 Input: Potassium = 3.2 mmol/L (female, 70 years old, heart failure patient on diuretics) Output: Hypokalemia. May worsen arrhythmias. Needs correction and monitoring.

Case 11 Input: Potassium = 4.2 mmol/L (male, 50 years old, healthy) Output: Normal potassium. No concern.

Case 12 Input: Potassium = 6.0 mmol/L (female, 60 years old, renal failure) Output: Hyperkalemia, high risk of cardiac arrest. Emergency treatment required.

Case 13 Input: Potassium = 3.6 mmol/L (athlete, male, 20 years old) Output: Normal but low-normal. Ensure hydration and potassium-rich foods.

Case 14 Input: Potassium = 4.9 mmol/L (pregnant female, 32 years old) Output: Upper-normal range. Monitor but no action required.

Case 15 Input: Potassium = 2.5 mmol/L (male, 40 years old, post-vomiting episode) Output: Severe hypokalemia, risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Needs urgent correction.

Case 16 Input: Potassium = 5.5 mmol/L (female, 25 years old, taking supplements) Output: Mild hyperkalemia due to supplement overuse. Reduce intake.

Case 17 Input: Potassium = 4.5 mmol/L (male, 70 years old, diabetic) Output: Normal but needs regular monitoring due to diabetes.

Case 18 Input: Potassium = 3.1 mmol/L (child, 7 years old, with diarrhea) Output: Hypokalemia due to GI losses. Needs oral or IV replacement.

Case 19 Input: Potassium = 5.9 mmol/L (male, 65 years old, heart failure) Output: Hyperkalemia, possibly drug-related (ACE inhibitor, spironolactone). Adjust therapy. 

Case 20 Input: Potassium = 3.8 mmol/L (female, 22 years old, healthy) Output: Normal. Maintain balanced diet.

Case 21 Input: Potassium = 6.2 mmol/L (infant, 3 months old, prematurity) Output: Hyperkalemia. Can be serious in infants. Pediatric emergency management required.

Case 22 Input: Potassium = 3.3 mmol/L (female, 45 years old, anorexia) Output: Hypokalemia due to poor nutrition. Needs correction and psychiatric/nutritional care.

Case 23 Input: Potassium = 5.0 mmol/L (male, 55 years old, liver disease) Output: Upper-normal. Monitor closely due to comorbidities.

Case 24 Input: Potassium = 2.8 mmol/L (female, 30 years old, marathon runner after event) Output: Severe hypokalemia due to loss through sweat and fluids. Needs urgent replacement.

Case 25 Input: Potassium = 4.6 mmol/L (male, 40 years old, smoker) Output: Normal. No action required. Lifestyle modification advised.
