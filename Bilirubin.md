# Bilirubin (Total and Direct)

**Normal Range:**  
- **Total Bilirubin:** 0.1 – 1.2 mg/dL  
- **Direct (Conjugated) Bilirubin:** 0.0 – 0.3 mg/dL  
- **Indirect (Unconjugated) Bilirubin:** Calculated as Total – Direct  

**Clinical Significance:**  
Bilirubin is a breakdown product of hemoglobin processed by the liver.  
- Elevated **indirect bilirubin**: hemolysis, ineffective red cell production, Gilbert’s syndrome.  
- Elevated **direct bilirubin**: liver dysfunction or bile duct obstruction.  
- Very high bilirubin causes **jaundice** and may indicate serious underlying disease.  


**Future Diseases Associated with Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Liver disease** (hepatitis, cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease)  
- **Hemolytic anemia**  
- **Gallstones / Bile duct obstruction**  
- **Genetic disorders** (e.g., Gilbert’s syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome)  
- **Pancreatic cancer with obstruction**  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Limit or avoid **alcohol** to protect liver health  
- Eat a **balanced diet** to support liver function  
- Maintain **hydration**  
- Seek medical care if **jaundice** or persistent fatigue develops  
- Regular **liver function monitoring** for high-risk individuals
