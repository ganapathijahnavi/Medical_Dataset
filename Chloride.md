# Chloride (Cl⁻)

**Normal Range:**  
98 – 107 mmol/L  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Chloride is the main extracellular anion that helps maintain **acid-base balance, fluid balance, and electrical neutrality** in the body.  
- **Hypochloremia (low chloride):** Often caused by vomiting, metabolic alkalosis, or overuse of diuretics.  
- **Hyperchloremia (high chloride):** Common in dehydration, kidney disease, or metabolic acidosis.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- **Hypochloremia:**  
  - Prolonged vomiting  
  - Cystic fibrosis  
  - Respiratory acidosis with compensation  

- **Hyperchloremia:**  
  - Dehydration  
  - Kidney failure  
  - Metabolic acidosis (diabetes, sepsis)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain adequate **hydration**  
- Use **balanced electrolyte solutions** if dehydrated  
- Avoid excessive **salt intake**  
- Treat underlying metabolic or renal disorders under medical guidance

# Case Studies 

### Case 1  
**Input:** Chloride = 102 mmol/L (male, 30 years old, healthy)  
**Output:** Normal chloride level. No concerns.  

---

### Case 2  
**Input:** Chloride = 92 mmol/L (female, 40 years old, prolonged vomiting)  
**Output:** Hypochloremia due to loss of stomach acid. Needs fluid and electrolyte replacement.  

---

### Case 3  
**Input:** Chloride = 110 mmol/L (male, 55 years old, dehydrated)  
**Output:** Hyperchloremia from dehydration. Recommend IV fluids.  

---

### Case 4  
**Input:** Chloride = 95 mmol/L (female, 60 years old, on diuretics)  
**Output:** Low chloride, medication-related. Adjust treatment under supervision.  

---

### Case 5  
**Input:** Chloride = 108 mmol/L (male, 65 years old, chronic kidney disease)
