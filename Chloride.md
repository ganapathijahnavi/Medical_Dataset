# Chloride (Cl⁻)

**Normal Range:**  
98 – 107 mmol/L  


**Clinical Significance:**  
Chloride is the main extracellular anion that helps maintain **acid-base balance, fluid balance, and electrical neutrality** in the body.  
- **Hypochloremia (low chloride):** Often caused by vomiting, metabolic alkalosis, or overuse of diuretics.  
- **Hyperchloremia (high chloride):** Common in dehydration, kidney disease, or metabolic acidosis.  

**Future Diseases:**  
- **Hypochloremia:**  
  - Prolonged vomiting  
  - Cystic fibrosis  
  - Respiratory acidosis with compensation  

- **Hyperchloremia:**  
  - Dehydration  
  - Kidney failure  
  - Metabolic acidosis (diabetes, sepsis)  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain adequate **hydration**  
- Use **balanced electrolyte solutions** if dehydrated  
- Avoid excessive **salt intake**  
- Treat underlying metabolic or renal disorders under medical guidance
