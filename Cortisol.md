# Cortisol

**Normal Range:**  
- Morning (6–8 AM): 6 – 23 µg/dL  
- Afternoon (4–6 PM): 3 – 13 µg/dL  
*(Levels naturally follow a diurnal rhythm, highest in the morning and lowest at night)*  


**Clinical Significance:**  
Cortisol is produced by the adrenal glands and plays a crucial role in **stress response, blood sugar regulation, metabolism, and immune function**. Abnormal levels help identify adrenal, pituitary, or stress-related conditions.


**Future Diseases / Risks:**  
- **High Cortisol:** Cushing’s syndrome, chronic stress, adrenal tumors, prolonged steroid use  
- **Low Cortisol:** Addison’s disease, pituitary insufficiency, adrenal crisis  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Stress management (meditation, yoga, sleep hygiene)  
- Balanced diet and regular exercise  
- Medical treatment and follow-up for adrenal disorders  
- Avoid abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroid medications  


**Case Interpretations:**

Case 1 – 8 µg/dL (healthy adult) → Normal.

Case 2 – 22 µg/dL (exam stress) → High-normal, stress response.

Case 3 – 3 µg/dL (fatigue, weight loss) → Low, Addison’s disease suspected.

Case 4 – 28 µg/dL (hypertension, obesity) → Elevated, possible Cushing’s.

Case 5 – 5 µg/dL (afternoon, healthy) → Normal for afternoon.

Case 6 – 1 µg/dL (sudden weakness, vomiting) → Critically low, adrenal crisis.

Case 7 – 10 µg/dL (shift worker) → Normal, diurnal rhythm may be altered.

Case 8 – 25 µg/dL (chronic steroid therapy) → Elevated, exogenous steroid effect.

Case 9 – 15 µg/dL (afternoon, insomnia) → High for afternoon, stress/Cushing’s suspected.

Case 10 – 7 µg/dL (borderline low, chronic fatigue) → Possible adrenal insufficiency, ACTH test needed.

Case 11 – 18 µg/dL (anxiety) → Mildly elevated, stress-induced.

Case 12 – 30 µg/dL (moon face, abdominal obesity) → Suggestive of Cushing’s.

Case 13 – 2 µg/dL (post-pituitary surgery) → Low, secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Case 14 – 16 µg/dL (well-controlled diabetic) → Normal.

Case 15 – 1 µg/dL (afternoon, healthy) → Low-normal, expected afternoon decline.

Case 16 – 12 µg/dL (cancer chemo patient) → Normal range, monitor for suppression.

Case 17 – 26 µg/dL (resistant hypertension) → Elevated, investigate Cushing’s/adrenal tumor.

Case 18 – 4 µg/dL (dizziness, low BP) → Low, adrenal insufficiency suspected.

Case 19 – 9 µg/dL (pregnant) → Normal, physiological increase possible.

Case 20 – 19 µg/dL (obesity, high blood sugar) → Elevated, possible metabolic syndrome.

Case 21 – 12 µg/dL (afternoon, teenager) → Upper-normal, monitor stress/endocrine factors.

Case 22 – 5 µg/dL (HIV patient) → Low, possible adrenal insufficiency.

Case 23 – 27 µg/dL (steroid withdrawal) → High rebound, Cushingoid features possible.

Case 24 – 14 µg/dL (chronic fatigue syndrome) → Normal, HPA-axis dysregulation may exist.

Case 25 – 32 µg/dL (adrenal mass) → Very high, cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor likely.
