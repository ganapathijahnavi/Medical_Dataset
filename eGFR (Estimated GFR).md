# Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)

**Normal Range:**  
≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (normal kidney function)  
60 – 89: Mildly decreased  
45 – 59: Mild to moderate decrease  
30 – 44: Moderate to severe decrease  
15 – 29: Severe decrease  
< 15: Kidney failure (end-stage renal disease)

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
eGFR estimates kidney function by calculating how much blood is filtered per minute by the kidneys. It is derived from creatinine, age, sex, and sometimes race. Lower values indicate impaired kidney function.

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
- End-stage renal disease (ESRD)  
- Hypertension-related kidney damage  
- Diabetic nephropathy  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Control blood pressure and blood sugar  
- Limit salt and protein intake if CKD  
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, contrast dyes)  
- Stay hydrated  
- Regular monitoring with a nephrologist

## Case Interpretations (25 Cases)

### Case 1  
**Input:** eGFR = 105 mL/min/1.73 m², healthy adult  
**Output:** Normal kidney function. Maintain healthy lifestyle.  

### Case 2  
**Input:** eGFR = 95 mL/min/1.73 m², 30-year-old male  
**Output:** Normal. No evidence of kidney disease.  

### Case 3  
**Input:** eGFR = 88 mL/min/1.73 m², 45-year-old female  
**Output:** Mildly decreased. Monitor regularly, especially if hypertensive or diabetic.  

### Case 4  
**Input:** eGFR = 80 mL/min/1.73 m², diabetic patient  
**Output:** Mildly reduced. Early CKD possible. Needs close follow-up.  

### Case 5  
**Input:** eGFR = 72 mL/min/1.73 m², hypertensive patient  
**Output:** Mild reduction. Hypertension may be affecting kidneys.  

### Case 6  
**Input:** eGFR = 65 mL/min/1.73 m², elderly patient  
**Output:** Mildly decreased. Could be age-related or early CKD.  

### Case 7  
**Input:** eGFR = 59 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Stage 3a CKD (mild to moderate). Requires regular nephrology care.  

### Case 8  
**Input:** eGFR = 52 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Stage 3a CKD. Control risk factors, adjust medications.  

### Case 9  
**Input:** eGFR = 48 mL/min/1.73 m², diabetic patient  
**Output:** Stage 3b CKD. Increased risk of complications. Needs specialist care.  

### Case 10  
**Input:** eGFR = 42 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Stage 3b CKD. Moderate to severe decrease. Lifestyle and medication adjustments required.  

### Case 11  
**Input:** eGFR = 38 mL/min/1.73 m², hypertensive  
**Output:** Significant kidney impairment. Control BP and consider nephrology referral.  

### Case 12  
**Input:** eGFR = 32 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Stage 3b CKD. High risk of progression. Diet modification and close follow-up required.  

### Case 13  
**Input:** eGFR = 28 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Stage 4 CKD. Severe decrease. Prepare for renal replacement therapy (dialysis/transplant).  

### Case 14  
**Input:** eGFR = 25 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Advanced CKD. Symptoms like fatigue, swelling likely. Nephrologist management essential.  

### Case 15  
**Input:** eGFR = 20 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Stage 4 CKD. Very severe. Begin discussions about dialysis or transplant.  

### Case 16  
**Input:** eGFR = 15 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Stage 5 CKD (borderline kidney failure). Requires renal replacement planning.  

### Case 17  
**Input:** eGFR = 12 mL/min/1.73 m², diabetic patient  
**Output:** End-stage kidney disease. Dialysis or transplant required.  

### Case 18  
**Input:** eGFR = 10 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Kidney failure. Symptoms likely severe (nausea, swelling). Dialysis essential.  

### Case 19  
**Input:** eGFR = 8 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** Critical renal failure. Immediate dialysis initiation needed.  

### Case 20  
**Input:** eGFR = 5 mL/min/1.73 m²  
**Output:** End-stage renal disease. Emergency management with dialysis/transplant.  

### Case 21  
**Input:** eGFR = 60 mL/min/1.73 m², 70-year-old  
**Output:** Lower normal for age. Regular monitoring needed.  

### Case 22  
**Input:** eGFR = 50 mL/min/1.73 m², patient on nephrotoxic drugs  
**Output:** Declining kidney function. Medication review required.  

### Case 23  
**Input:** eGFR = 92 mL/min/1.73 m², pregnancy  
**Output:** Normal. Kidney function usually preserved or increased during pregnancy.  

### Case 24  
**Input:** eGFR = 40 mL/min/1.73 m², proteinuria present  
**Output:** CKD with protein loss. Higher risk of progression. Needs strict control.  

### Case 25  
**Input:** eGFR = 15 mL/min/1.73 m², anemia present  
**Output:** Kidney failure with anemia (erythropoietin deficiency). Needs dialysis and EPO therapy.
