# White Blood Cell Count (WBC)

**Normal Range:**  
4,500 - 11,000 cells per microliter  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
WBCs are immune cells that protect against infection.  
- **Elevated levels (leukocytosis):** suggest infection, inflammation, stress, or leukemia.  
- **Low levels (leukopenia):** may indicate bone marrow suppression, autoimmune diseases, or certain viral infections.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Infections (bacterial, viral, fungal)  
- Leukemia  
- Autoimmune disorders  
- Bone marrow failure  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Maintain good hygiene to avoid infections  
- Eat a balanced diet with adequate vitamins  
- Ensure sufficient sleep and stress management  
- Avoid unnecessary antibiotic use  
- Seek medical advice for persistent abnormalities

### Case Studies:

Case 1

Input: WBC = 6,000/µL
Output: Normal. Healthy immune function.

Case 2

Input: WBC = 4,800/µL
Output: Normal, on the lower end of range. Monitor if symptoms develop.

Case 3

Input: WBC = 12,000/µL, fever
Output: Elevated. Suggests bacterial infection.

Case 4

Input: WBC = 3,800/µL
Output: Low. Possible viral infection or bone marrow suppression.

Case 5

Input: WBC = 15,000/µL
Output: High. Suggestive of infection or inflammation.

Case 6

Input: WBC = 2,500/µL
Output: Very low. Possible bone marrow failure, chemotherapy effect, or autoimmune condition.

Case 7

Input: WBC = 9,500/µL
Output: Normal. No concerns.

Case 8

Input: WBC = 20,000/µL
Output: Markedly elevated. Could indicate severe infection or leukemia. Needs urgent evaluation.

Case 9

Input: WBC = 4,600/µL
Output: Normal but close to lower limit. Monitor if symptoms present.

Case 10

Input: WBC = 30,000/µL
Output: Critically high. Possible acute leukemia or severe sepsis. Emergency care needed.

Case 11

Input: WBC = 5,200/µL
Output: Normal range. Healthy immune status.

Case 12

Input: WBC = 3,000/µL, recurrent infections
Output: Low. Likely immune deficiency or bone marrow disorder.

Case 13

Input: WBC = 18,000/µL, pneumonia
Output: Elevated, consistent with bacterial pneumonia.

Case 14

Input: WBC = 4,400/µL
Output: Slightly low. Could be viral infection or mild suppression. Monitor closely.

Case 15

Input: WBC = 50,000/µL
Output: Extremely high. Strong suspicion of leukemia. Urgent hematology referral required.

Case 16

Input: WBC = 7,000/µL
Output: Normal. No issues.

Case 17

Input: WBC = 10,500/µL
Output: Upper normal limit. Could reflect mild stress response.

Case 18

Input: WBC = 2,000/µL
Output: Critically low. High risk of infections. Possible bone marrow failure.

Case 19

Input: WBC = 11,500/µL, sore throat
Output: Elevated, consistent with infection.

Case 20

Input: WBC = 5,800/µL
Output: Normal. Healthy range.

Case 21

Input: WBC = 14,000/µL, post-surgery
Output: Elevated. Could be surgical stress response or infection. Needs monitoring.

Case 22

Input: WBC = 8,500/µL
Output: Normal. No signs of disease.

Case 23

Input: WBC = 3,200/µL, on chemotherapy
Output: Low, expected due to chemotherapy. Monitor for infections.

Case 24

Input: WBC = 25,000/µL
Output: Very high. Suggestive of leukemia or severe sepsis.

Case 25

Input: WBC = 4,900/µL
Output: Normal, stable immune function.
