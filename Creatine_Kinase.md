# Creatine Kinase (CK)

**Normal Range:**  
26 â€“ 192 U/L  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
Creatine Kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in **skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissue**.  
- Elevated levels indicate **muscle damage, inflammation, or cardiac injury**.  
- CK isoenzymes (CK-MM, CK-MB, CK-BB) can help distinguish between **muscle vs. cardiac vs. brain origin**.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Muscular dystrophy  
- Myocarditis  
- Rhabdomyolysis  
- Myositis  
- Heart attack (via CK-MB)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid strenuous exercise if CK is elevated  
- Stay hydrated to protect kidneys from muscle breakdown products  
- Regular medical evaluation if persistently abnormal  
- Follow cardiology or neurology guidance depending on cause
