# Creatine Kinase (CK)

**Normal Range:**  
26 – 192 U/L  

**Clinical Significance:**  
Creatine Kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in **skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and brain tissue**.  
- Elevated levels indicate **muscle damage, inflammation, or cardiac injury**.  
- CK isoenzymes (CK-MM, CK-MB, CK-BB) can help distinguish between **muscle vs. cardiac vs. brain origin**.  


**Future Diseases:**  
- Muscular dystrophy  
- Myocarditis  
- Rhabdomyolysis  
- Myositis  
- Heart attack (via CK-MB)  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid strenuous exercise if CK is elevated  
- Stay hydrated to protect kidneys from muscle breakdown products  
- Regular medical evaluation if persistently abnormal  
- Follow cardiology or neurology guidance depending on cause  


**Case Studies:** 

Case 1 – 80 U/L (healthy athlete) → Normal.

Case 2 – 250 U/L (post-workout) → Mildly elevated, exercise-related.

Case 3 – 600 U/L (chest pain, CK-MB ↑) → MI suspected, urgent care.

Case 4 – 1200 U/L (on statins) → Statin-induced myopathy.

Case 5 – 400 U/L (football injury) → Muscle trauma, rest advised.

Case 6 – 95 U/L (healthy) → Normal.

Case 7 – 8000 U/L (crush injury) → Severe rhabdomyolysis, ICU.

Case 8 – 300 U/L (hypothyroidism) → Hypothyroid myopathy, treat thyroid.

Case 9 – 180 U/L (diabetic) → Normal, monitor.

Case 10 – 950 U/L (lupus, weakness) → Possible inflammatory myositis.

Case 11 – 1300 U/L (heart failure, CK-MB ↑) → Cardiac origin suspected.

Case 12 – 270 U/L (marathon) → Exercise-induced.

Case 13 – 50 U/L (healthy) → Normal.

Case 14 – 2000 U/L (muscular dystrophy family history) → Genetic/neurology follow-up.

Case 15 – 175 U/L (mild fatigue) → Normal.

Case 16 – 6000 U/L (heat stroke) → Rhabdomyolysis, emergency hydration.

Case 17 – 320 U/L (myocarditis suspected) → Cardiac inflammation, imaging advised.

Case 18 – 170 U/L (hypertension) → Normal.

Case 19 – 1000 U/L (viral infection) → Viral myositis, supportive care.

Case 20 – 260 U/L (HIV on ART) → Mild drug-induced elevation, monitor.

Case 21 – 4800 U/L (post-seizure) → Seizure-induced rhabdomyolysis.

Case 22 – 240 U/L (mild chest discomfort, CK-MB normal) → Non-cardiac source.

Case 23 – 16000 U/L (drug overdose, immobilized) → Severe rhabdomyolysis, dialysis may be needed.

Case 24 – 300 U/L (polymyositis) → Chronic inflammatory myopathy.

Case 25 – 140 U/L (healthy) → Normal.
