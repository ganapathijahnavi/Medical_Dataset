# D-dimer

**Normal Range:**  
< 0.5 µg/mL FEU (Fibrinogen Equivalent Units)


**Clinical Significance:**  
D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, formed when blood clots are broken down.  
- **Elevated levels** → presence of abnormal clot formation and breakdown.  
- Not specific: can be elevated in many conditions (thrombosis, infection, cancer, trauma).  
- Commonly used to **rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**.  


**Future Diseases:**  
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  
- Pulmonary embolism (PE)  
- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)  
- Cardiovascular events (MI, stroke)  
- Cancer-related thrombosis  


**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid prolonged immobility (travel, bed rest)  
- Stop smoking and maintain heart health  
- Seek urgent medical attention if clotting symptoms occur (leg swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath)  


**Case Interpretations:**

Case 1 – 0.2 µg/mL → Normal.
Case 2 – 1.5 µg/mL → Elevated, likely DVT. Doppler USG needed.

Case 3 – 2.0 µg/mL → Suggests PE. CT pulmonary angiography required.

Case 4 – 0.45 µg/mL → Normal.

Case 5 – 3.0 µg/mL → Very high, possible DIC. Monitor coagulation.

Case 6 – 0.6 µg/mL → Slightly elevated, normal in pregnancy.

Case 7 – 1.2 µg/mL → Possible DVT. Imaging required.

Case 8 – 0.4 µg/mL → Normal.

Case 9 – 0.8 µg/mL → Elevated due to infection/inflammation.

Case 10 – 2.5 µg/mL → High, may indicate DIC/active clot breakdown.

Case 11 – 0.1 µg/mL → Normal.

Case 12 – 5.0 µg/mL → Very high, cancer-associated thrombosis.

Case 13 – 0.55 µg/mL → Borderline, rule out early DVT.

Case 14 – 3.8 µg/mL → Post-surgical clotting activity. Monitor DVT/PE.

Case 15 – 0.3 µg/mL → Normal.

Case 16 – 7.0 µg/mL → Extremely high, severe DIC. Emergency care.

Case 17 – 1.0 µg/mL → Elevated in COVID-19; monitor clotting.

Case 18 – 0.25 µg/mL → Normal.

Case 19 – 4.5 µg/mL → High risk VTE. Immediate evaluation.

Case 20 – 0.7 µg/mL → Elevated post-trauma. Monitor for DVT.

Case 21 – 2.2 µg/mL → Suggestive of PE. Urgent imaging.

Case 22 – 0.15 µg/mL → Normal.

Case 23 – 3.2 µg/mL → Elevated, may indicate acute ischemic stroke.

Case 24 – 0.6 µg/mL → Slightly high; monitor venous stasis.

Case 25 – 10 µg/mL → Extremely high, severe DIC. Critical emergency.
