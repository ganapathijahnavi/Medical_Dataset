# D-dimer

**Normal Range:**  
< 0.5 µg/mL FEU (Fibrinogen Equivalent Units)

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product, formed when blood clots are broken down.  
- **Elevated levels** → presence of abnormal clot formation and breakdown.  
- Not specific: can be elevated in many conditions (thrombosis, infection, cancer, trauma).  
- Commonly used to **rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**.  

---

**Future Diseases:**  
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)  
- Pulmonary embolism (PE)  
- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)  
- Cardiovascular events (MI, stroke)  
- Cancer-related thrombosis  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Avoid prolonged immobility (travel, bed rest)  
- Stop smoking and maintain heart health  
- Seek urgent medical attention if clotting symptoms occur (leg swelling, chest pain, shortness of breath)

# Case Interpretations

## Case 1  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.2 µg/mL, healthy adult  
**Output:** Normal. No evidence of abnormal clotting.

---

## Case 2  
**Input:** D-dimer = 1.5 µg/mL, patient with calf swelling and pain  
**Output:** Elevated, likely **DVT**. Requires Doppler ultrasound for confirmation.

---

## Case 3  
**Input:** D-dimer = 2.0 µg/mL, patient with sudden chest pain and breathlessness  
**Output:** Suggestive of **pulmonary embolism**. Requires CT pulmonary angiography.

---

## Case 4  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.45 µg/mL, elderly patient with no symptoms  
**Output:** Normal. No evidence of clotting.

---

## Case 5  
**Input:** D-dimer = 3.0 µg/mL, ICU patient with sepsis  
**Output:** Very high. Possible **DIC**. Monitor coagulation profile.

---

## Case 6  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.6 µg/mL, pregnant woman, 30 weeks  
**Output:** Slightly elevated. **Normal in pregnancy** due to hypercoagulable state. Monitor if symptoms arise.

---

## Case 7  
**Input:** D-dimer = 1.2 µg/mL, smoker with leg pain  
**Output:** Possible **DVT**. Further vascular imaging required.

---

## Case 8  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.4 µg/mL, young athlete post-exercise  
**Output:** Normal. No concern.

---

## Case 9  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.8 µg/mL, elderly with pneumonia  
**Output:** Elevated due to **infection and inflammation**. Not necessarily thrombosis.

---

## Case 10  
**Input:** D-dimer = 2.5 µg/mL, trauma patient with internal bleeding  
**Output:** High. May indicate **DIC or active clot breakdown**.

---

## Case 11  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.1 µg/mL, child with flu  
**Output:** Normal. Clotting not involved.

---

## Case 12  
**Input:** D-dimer = 5.0 µg/mL, advanced cancer patient  
**Output:** Very high. Likely **cancer-associated thrombosis**.

---

## Case 13  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.55 µg/mL, elderly woman with mild leg swelling  
**Output:** Borderline high. Rule out **early DVT** with imaging.

---

## Case 14  
**Input:** D-dimer = 3.8 µg/mL, patient after major surgery  
**Output:** Elevated due to **post-surgical clotting activity**. Monitor for DVT/PE.

---

## Case 15  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.3 µg/mL, diabetic patient  
**Output:** Normal. No abnormal clotting.

---

## Case 16  
**Input:** D-dimer = 7.0 µg/mL, patient with shock and bleeding  
**Output:** Extremely high. Suggests **DIC**. Emergency care needed.

---

## Case 17  
**Input:** D-dimer = 1.0 µg/mL, COVID-19 patient  
**Output:** Elevated. COVID-19 commonly causes **hypercoagulability**. Monitor for clotting complications.

---

## Case 18  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.25 µg/mL, routine check-up  
**Output:** Normal. No clotting disorder.

---

## Case 19  
**Input:** D-dimer = 4.5 µg/mL, bedridden elderly patient  
**Output:** High risk for **venous thromboembolism**. Immediate evaluation needed.

---

## Case 20  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.7 µg/mL, recent fracture  
**Output:** Elevated due to **trauma-related clotting**. Monitor for DVT.

---

## Case 21  
**Input:** D-dimer = 2.2 µg/mL, postpartum woman with shortness of breath  
**Output:** Suggestive of **pulmonary embolism**. Requires urgent imaging.

---

## Case 22  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.15 µg/mL, healthy child  
**Output:** Normal. No clotting risk.

---

## Case 23  
**Input:** D-dimer = 3.2 µg/mL, patient with stroke symptoms  
**Output:** Elevated. May indicate **acute ischemic stroke** with clot involvement.

---

## Case 24  
**Input:** D-dimer = 0.6 µg/mL, elderly with varicose veins  
**Output:** Slightly high. Could be related to **venous stasis**. Monitor.

---

## Case 25  
**Input:** D-dimer = 10 µg/mL, septic shock patient in ICU  
**Output:** Extremely high, indicates **severe DIC**. Critical emergency.
