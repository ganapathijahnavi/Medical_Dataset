# Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)

**Normal Range:**  
≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (normal kidney function)  
60 – 89: Mildly decreased  
45 – 59: Mild to moderate decrease  
30 – 44: Moderate to severe decrease  
15 – 29: Severe decrease  
< 15: Kidney failure (end-stage renal disease)

**Clinical Significance:**  
eGFR estimates kidney function by calculating how much blood is filtered per minute by the kidneys. It is derived from creatinine, age, sex, and sometimes race. Lower values indicate impaired kidney function.

**Future Diseases:**  
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
- End-stage renal disease (ESRD)  
- Hypertension-related kidney damage  
- Diabetic nephropathy  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Control blood pressure and blood sugar  
- Limit salt and protein intake if CKD  
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, contrast dyes)  
- Stay hydrated  
- Regular monitoring with a nephrologist  

**Case Studies:**

Case 1

Input: eGFR = 105 mL/min/1.73 m², healthy adult
Output: Normal kidney function. Maintain healthy lifestyle.

Case 2

Input: eGFR = 95 mL/min/1.73 m², 30-year-old male
Output: Normal. No evidence of kidney disease.

Case 3

Input: eGFR = 88 mL/min/1.73 m², 45-year-old female
Output: Mildly decreased. Monitor regularly, especially if hypertensive or diabetic.

Case 4

Input: eGFR = 80 mL/min/1.73 m², diabetic patient
Output: Mildly reduced. Early CKD possible. Needs close follow-up.

Case 5

Input: eGFR = 72 mL/min/1.73 m², hypertensive patient
Output: Mild reduction. Hypertension may be affecting kidneys.

Case 6

Input: eGFR = 65 mL/min/1.73 m², elderly patient
Output: Mildly decreased. Could be age-related or early CKD.

Case 7

Input: eGFR = 59 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Stage 3a CKD (mild to moderate). Requires regular nephrology care.

Case 8

Input: eGFR = 52 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Stage 3a CKD. Control risk factors, adjust medications.

Case 9

Input: eGFR = 48 mL/min/1.73 m², diabetic patient
Output: Stage 3b CKD. Increased risk of complications. Needs specialist care.

Case 10

Input: eGFR = 42 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Stage 3b CKD. Moderate to severe decrease. Lifestyle and medication adjustments required.

Case 11

Input: eGFR = 38 mL/min/1.73 m², hypertensive
Output: Significant kidney impairment. Control BP and consider nephrology referral.

Case 12

Input: eGFR = 32 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Stage 3b CKD. High risk of progression. Diet modification and close follow-up required.

Case 13

Input: eGFR = 28 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Stage 4 CKD. Severe decrease. Prepare for renal replacement therapy (dialysis/transplant).

Case 14

Input: eGFR = 25 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Advanced CKD. Symptoms like fatigue, swelling likely. Nephrologist management essential.

Case 15

Input: eGFR = 20 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Stage 4 CKD. Very severe. Begin discussions about dialysis or transplant.

Case 16

Input: eGFR = 15 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Stage 5 CKD (borderline kidney failure). Requires renal replacement planning.

Case 17

Input: eGFR = 12 mL/min/1.73 m², diabetic patient
Output: End-stage kidney disease. Dialysis or transplant required.

Case 18

Input: eGFR = 10 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Kidney failure. Symptoms likely severe (nausea, swelling). Dialysis essential.

Case 19

Input: eGFR = 8 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: Critical renal failure. Immediate dialysis initiation needed.

Case 20

Input: eGFR = 5 mL/min/1.73 m²
Output: End-stage renal disease. Emergency management with dialysis/transplant.

Case 21

Input: eGFR = 60 mL/min/1.73 m², 70-year-old
Output: Lower normal for age. Regular monitoring needed.

Case 22

Input: eGFR = 50 mL/min/1.73 m², patient on nephrotoxic drugs
Output: Declining kidney function. Medication review required.

Case 23

Input: eGFR = 92 mL/min/1.73 m², pregnancy
Output: Normal. Kidney function usually preserved or increased during pregnancy.

Case 24

Input: eGFR = 40 mL/min/1.73 m², proteinuria present
Output: CKD with protein loss. Higher risk of progression. Needs strict control.

Case 25

Input: eGFR = 15 mL/min/1.73 m², anemia present
Output: Kidney failure with anemia (erythropoietin deficiency). Needs dialysis and EPO therapy.
