# C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

**Normal Range:**  
- **< 3 mg/L** → Normal (low cardiovascular and inflammation risk)  
- **3 – 10 mg/L** → Mild elevation (possible low-grade inflammation, infection, obesity, smoking)  
- **> 10 mg/L** → Significant elevation (active infection, autoimmune disorder, severe inflammation)  

**Clinical Significance:**  
CRP is a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation.  
- **Elevated CRP** suggests **acute or chronic inflammation**, but not the cause.  
- Used to monitor **infection, autoimmune disease activity, and cardiovascular risk**.  
- **hs-CRP** is a more sensitive version for predicting **heart disease risk**.  


**Future Diseases Associated with Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Cardiovascular disease** (atherosclerosis, heart attack risk)  
- **Autoimmune disorders** (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease)  
- **Infections** (bacterial, viral, parasitic)  
- **Chronic inflammatory conditions** (obesity, metabolic syndrome)  

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Follow an **anti-inflammatory diet** (fruits, vegetables, omega-3 fatty acids)  
- Maintain **healthy weight**  
- **Exercise regularly** but avoid overtraining during illness  
- Avoid **smoking and excessive alcohol**  
- Monitor and treat underlying chronic conditions  

**Case Studies:**

Output: Strongly elevated due to acute infection.
Recommendation: Antibiotics, monitor CRP.

Case 4

Case 7
Input: CRP = 12 mg/L (male, 40, obesity + diabetes)
Output: Elevated due to metabolic inflammation.
Recommendation: Weight loss, diabetes management.

Case 8
Input: CRP = 70 mg/L (female, 70, UTI)
Output: Significantly elevated due to infection.
Recommendation: Antibiotics, hydration, monitor.

Case 9
Input: CRP = 0.5 mg/L (male, 28, athlete)
Output: Normal.
Recommendation: Continue healthy lifestyle.

Case 10
Input: CRP = 6 mg/L (female, 38, mild joint pain)
Output: Mildly elevated, could suggest early autoimmune disorder.
Recommendation: Rheumatology evaluation.

Case 11
Input: CRP = 150 mg/L (male, 55, sepsis)
Output: Extremely high, severe infection.
Recommendation: ICU management, antibiotics, fluids.

Case 12
Input: CRP = 2.5 mg/L (female, 65, heart disease risk)
Output: Borderline cardiovascular risk (hs-CRP).
Recommendation: Optimize cholesterol and BP.

Case 13
Input: CRP = 85 mg/L (male, 75, post-surgery infection)

Recommendation: Hospital admission, IV antibiotics.

Case 17
Input: CRP = 2.2 mg/L (male, 50, mild hypertension)
Output: Normal but slightly elevated.
Recommendation: Lifestyle changes, cardiovascular monitoring.

Case 18
Input: CRP = 18 mg/L (female, 30, lupus flare)
Output: Elevated due to autoimmune inflammation.
Recommendation: Rheumatology treatment adjustment.

Case 19
Input: CRP = 0.9 mg/L (male, 22, healthy)

Input: CRP = 0.6 mg/L (female, 25, pregnant)
Output: Normal.
Recommendation: Routine prenatal care.

Case 23
Input: CRP = 45 mg/L (male, 65, heart attack + infection)
Output: High due to combined inflammation.
Recommendation: Cardiology and infection management.

Case 24
Input: CRP = 2.7 mg/L (female, 35, sedentary, obese)
