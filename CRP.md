# C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

**Normal Range:**  
- **< 3 mg/L** → Normal (low cardiovascular and inflammation risk)  
- **3 – 10 mg/L** → Mild elevation (possible low-grade inflammation, infection, obesity, smoking)  
- **> 10 mg/L** → Significant elevation (active infection, autoimmune disorder, severe inflammation)  

---

**Clinical Significance:**  
CRP is a protein produced by the liver in response to inflammation.  
- **Elevated CRP** suggests **acute or chronic inflammation**, but not the cause.  
- Used to monitor **infection, autoimmune disease activity, and cardiovascular risk**.  
- **hs-CRP** is a more sensitive version for predicting **heart disease risk**.  

---

**Future Diseases Associated with Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Cardiovascular disease** (atherosclerosis, heart attack risk)  
- **Autoimmune disorders** (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease)  
- **Infections** (bacterial, viral, parasitic)  
- **Chronic inflammatory conditions** (obesity, metabolic syndrome)  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Follow an **anti-inflammatory diet** (fruits, vegetables, omega-3 fatty acids)  
- Maintain **healthy weight**  
- **Exercise regularly** but avoid overtraining during illness  
- Avoid **smoking and excessive alcohol**  
- Monitor and treat underlying chronic conditions
