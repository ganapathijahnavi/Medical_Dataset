# Ferritin

**Normal Range (Reference Intervals):**  
- **Men (adult):** 24 – 336 ng/mL  
- **Women (adult):** 11 – 307 ng/mL  
- **Children (6 months – 15 years):** 7 – 140 ng/mL  
- **Infants (0–5 months):** 50 – 200 ng/mL  
- **Pregnancy (2nd–3rd trimester):** > 10–15 ng/mL (tends to be lower due to demand)

**Clinical Significance:**  
Ferritin is the primary storage form of iron in the body and reflects total body iron stores.  
- **Low Ferritin:** Strongest indicator of iron deficiency anemia.  
- **High Ferritin:** May indicate iron overload (hemochromatosis, multiple transfusions) or an inflammatory response, since ferritin also acts as an acute-phase reactant.  

---

**Future Diseases & Risks of Abnormal Levels:**  
- **Low Ferritin:**  
  - Iron-deficiency anemia  
  - Chronic blood loss (GI bleeding, menstruation)  
  - Malnutrition or poor diet  
  - Malabsorption (celiac disease, IBD)  

- **High Ferritin:**  
  - Hemochromatosis (iron overload disorder)  
  - Chronic liver disease (alcoholic or non-alcoholic)  
  - Multiple blood transfusions  
  - Chronic inflammatory diseases (RA, lupus, infections)  
  - Malignancy  

---

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- **If Low:**  
  - Eat iron-rich foods (red meat, poultry, legumes, leafy greens).  
  - Take iron supplements only under medical advice.  
  - Address sources of blood loss (heavy periods, GI bleeding).  

- **If High:**  
  - Avoid excess iron and vitamin C supplements (which increase absorption).  
  - Limit alcohol intake (protects liver).  
  - Monitor with physician for possible phlebotomy or chelation.

# Case Studies 

### Case 1  
**Input:** Ferritin = 10 ng/mL (female, 25 years old)  
**Output:** Low ferritin → iron deficiency anemia likely.  
**Recommendation:** Increase iron intake, rule out menstrual blood loss.  

---

### Case 2  
**Input:** Ferritin = 250 ng/mL (male, 40 years old)  
**Output:** Normal for adult male.  
**Recommendation:** No intervention required.  

---

### Case 3  
**Input:** Ferritin = 500 ng/mL (male, 55 years old, liver disease)

**Recommendation:** Hepatology evaluation, avoid alcohol.  

---

### Case 4  
**Input:** Ferritin = 8 ng/mL (female, 35 years old, heavy menstruation)  
**Output:** Very low → iron deficiency anemia.  
**Recommendation:** Gynecology review, iron therapy.  

---

### Case 5  
**Input:** Ferritin = 100 ng/mL (female, 28 years old, pregnant)  
**Output:** Within normal for pregnancy, no concern.  
**Recommendation:** Continue prenatal vitamins.  

---

### Case 6  
**Input:** Ferritin = 700 ng/mL (male, 60 years old, multiple transfusions)  
**Output:** Iron overload due to transfusions.  
**Recommendation:** Hematology consult, possible chelation therapy.  

---

### Case 7  
**Input:** Ferritin = 30 ng/mL (child, 10 years old, poor diet)  
**Output:** Low-normal, risk of deficiency.  
**Recommendation:** Improve nutrition, pediatric follow-up.  

---

### Case 8  
**Input:** Ferritin = 20 ng/mL (female, 50 years old, vegetarian)  
**Output:** Low, dietary iron deficiency likely.  
**Recommendation:** Iron supplementation, dietary counseling.  

---

### Case 9  
**Input:** Ferritin = 350 ng/mL (male, 35 years old, healthy)  
**Output:** Slightly above normal, possible early overload.  
**Recommendation:** Recheck, lifestyle review, avoid iron supplements.  

---

### Case 10  
**Input:** Ferritin = 5 ng/mL (child, 5 years old)  
**Output:** Very low, iron deficiency anemia.  
**Recommendation:** Iron supplementation, check for parasitic infections.  

---

### Case 11  
**Input:** Ferritin = 280 ng/mL (female, 65 years old)
